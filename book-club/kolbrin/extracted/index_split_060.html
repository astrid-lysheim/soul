<h2 id="id_Toc5199833" class="block_12">Chapter Twenty-Six. From The Scroll Of Senmut</h2>
	<p class="block_9"> </p>
	<p class="block_8">The stonebearer measures the stone and it is trimmed and pushed into place. It is fitted and the overseer looks upon it and says, "This stone is well laid. It remains in its appointed place".</p>
	<p class="block_8">Beside it other stones are fitted and set, each according to its own shape and design, each has its own place and position. Then upon it are placed other stones and so it becomes concealed from sight in the foundations of the structure. The building rises, firm and strong, to become the dwelling place of a prince.</p>
	<p class="block_8">I am one of whom men say, "He establishes buildings which stand forever". I remember that stone deep below the ground in the base of the structure where no eye ever sees it. Men know it is there, it just remains in its place, fulfilling its appointed duty, a necessity for the upholding of the building.</p>
	<p class="block_8">What difference whether that stone be set upon the pinnacle, shining in the sun, ever before the eyes of men, or hidden in the ground, unseen at the base? It does its duty by standing solidly in its rightful place and seeking not to change it.</p>
	<p class="block_8">I, who establish great buildings which will stand forever, remember that stone.</p>
