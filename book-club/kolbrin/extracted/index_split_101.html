<h1 id="id_Toc5199874" class="block_5">Note Found In The Cover Of An Old Copy Of The Kolbrin</h1>
	<p class="block_9"> </p>
	<p class="block_8">What follows was not discovered among the shards, but was said to be found within the cover of an old copy of <b class="calibre12">the Kolbrin.</b></p>
	<p class="block_8">"When I was young my grand-father told me that the Kolbrin had been brought back to light by his grand-father's people in the place known to them as Futeril Cairn, beyond the pool of Pantlyn at Carclathan by way of Gwendwor in Wales."</p>
	<p class="block_8">"I remember him saying it was originally written in the old alphabet of thirty-six letters. The books were stored in a tinker's budget box, the lid of which was not hinged but held with flanges and lifted off after being heated, a cuning device of the wayfaring tinkers. It was also secured with pins and stirrups. There were goblin heads at the corners and it was fastened by locking bars inside and out. I never saw it, nor did I know anyone who knew whether it still existed."</p>
	<p class="block_8">"I remember being told that inside the box was a clear glass roundish ball about the size of a large apple, which at one spot reflected all the colours of the rainbow. It was encased in a precious cagework inside a protective cover of horny hide which had raised swellings, the like of which my grand-father had never seen before. He knew a lot about animals and their hides, but could not tell what this was; he thought it might have been the hide of some kind of large, horny snakelike creature such as those which live in deep lakes."</p>
	<p class="block_8">"There were two stones of dullish glass like rainstones, one being whitish at one end. Each was oval in shape and somewhat flattened and tapered towards one end. Grand-mother used to tell fortunes with these and they went to cousin Sarah in America. There were two other pieces of rounded glass set in something made of bone which had pretty designs engraved on it. The bone setting was falling apart and was of no conceivable use. There was also a bluish coloured cross with an opening at the top and its arms were forked at the ends. This was fastened by a small chain curiously worked, to piece of round brass about the size of a small plate which was engraved with figured, of which a bird, a wand, two billhooks, a whip and some heads could be made out. There were beads of blue and red and a brooch shaped like a hook and made of gold. There was a acorn-like cap such as Flamens wear."</p>
	<p class="block_8">"There was also a longish brass object like a knife, with engraving, in a wrapping of rotten wood. That is all there was, except for the books which were not like books at all. I do not know what became of the other items. I saw the glass ball once when I was a small child but cannot remember much about it, except that it was hollow at one end and when I put a finger in the hollow it felt warm."</p>
