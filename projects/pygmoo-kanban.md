## 📝 Notes

- **Father consultation:** José had a long chat with his father about PygMoo. Father is experienced (managing director of many companies) and wants help building his own tool. Details coming this week.
- **OpenClaw acquisition:** OpenAI acquired OpenClaw. Claims to keep open-source. We have blueprints if we need to fork.
