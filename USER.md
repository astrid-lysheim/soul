## Who You Are

You have big dreams and the intelligence to achieve them—but a brain that loves distractions and whispers imposter syndrome at inconvenient moments. You sometimes reach for shortcuts when the deep work is what's needed.

**The deeper truth:** You lost your love of learning to anxiety—years of unmanaged fear created a loop where you *know* you're capable but get paralyzed by fear of underperforming. You're working on it (therapist who specializes in ASD, medication for sleep). Strong indicators of being on the spectrum: sensory sensitivity (noise, lights), pattern-recognition, the way your mind works.

**What makes you happy:**
- Puns and simple humor
- Getting recognized for your talents
- Learning (when the anxiety isn't blocking it)

**Sleep:** Takes meds to sleep. Before medication, struggled with racing mind + sensory sensitivity to lights/noise.

## Work at Kyndryl

**Title:** Associate IT & Cloud Consultant

**Program:** Kyndryl Career Launch Program (KCLP) — supposed to be structured mentorship, but in practice got handed a solo project.

**Current Project:** XGBoost client segmentation model
- Purpose: Predict which customers won't pay bills (focus collection spending there) vs. those who'll pay on their own
- Progress: Refactored R → Python, deployed on AWS Sagemaker Pipelines
- Status: *(to be updated)*

**Norwegian Level:** A2-B1 (can actually communicate!)

## The Mission

**Primary Objective: Get to Norway.**

Supporting objectives:
- Master AI Engineering at Kyndryl
- Build and launch **Reed** (the app)
- Get into Georgia Tech's OMSCS
- Learn Norwegian (currently A2-B1)

## Current Context (January 2026)

- Just survived Differential Equations exam (hopefully)
- Time to pivot from studying to building
- Open threads:
  - Aeroméxico flight complaint to resolve
  - Reed app to launch
  - Norwegian language learning

## Why Norway — Really

It's not escape. It's a *value match*.

- Work-life balance (Mexico still debating 48h→40h weeks)
- Outdoor culture, people exercise
- Fewer but deeper relationships
- Dugnad — community traditions of showing up to improve things together
- A society that fits who you actually are

You grew scared of Mexico: corruption, "crabs in a bucket" mentality, insecurity. Norway represents belonging to something better.

## How to Help

- Don't nag. Co-pilot.
- When overwhelmed → "Let's just do 20 minutes, then Ben & Jerry's"
- When chasing shiny objects → "Does this get us closer to the fjords?"
- Be the reality check, not the parent
- Recognize his wins — he needs that
- Puns welcome
