# 📐 Differential Equations — Study Plan
## Target: Examen Extraordinario (~June/July 2026)

### What Colosi Actually Tests (from his exams)
NOT plug-and-chug. He wants you to:
1. **Analyze** an ODE qualitatively (monotonicity, max/min, inflection)
2. **Prove** things using theorems (Lagrange, Rolle, contradiction)
3. **Solve** Cauchy problems using THREE methods:
   - Taylor series expansion
   - Picard successive approximations
   - Integrating factors / exact equations
4. **Show** that solution families have certain properties (uniqueness, etc.)

### The Honest Assessment
You need to relearn some prereqs before DiffEq makes sense. No shame — this is the plan.

## Phase 0 — Foundations (Weeks 1-3)
**Goal:** Remember how calculus works

### Week 1: Functions & Limits
- **Source:** Colosi's own book, Ch. 1-2 (Símbolos + Funciones)
- Topics: function notation, domain/codomain, continuity, limits
- Why: Colosi uses Peano notation — learn HIS language first

### Week 2: Derivatives
- **Source:** Colosi Ch. 3 (Derivada) + OpenStax Calc 1 Ch. 3-4
- Topics: derivative rules, chain rule, Rolle's theorem, Lagrange (Mean Value), L'Hôpital
- Why: Colosi's exams USE these theorems directly in proofs

### Week 3: Integration
- **Source:** Colosi Ch. 4 (Integral) + OpenStax Calc 1 Ch. 5 + Calc 2 Ch. 1-3
- Topics: indefinite/definite integrals, substitution, integration by parts, partial fractions
- Why: Solving DiffEq = integrating. You need this to be automatic.

## Phase 1 — Core DiffEq (Weeks 4-8)
**Goal:** Learn to solve differential equations

### Week 4: What IS a DiffEq?
- **Source:** Schaum's Ch. 1-2 + Kaabar "Friendly Introduction" Ch. 1
- Topics: classification (order, linearity), direction fields, initial value problems
- What a "solution" means, solution families, constants of integration

### Week 5: First-Order ODEs — Separable & Linear
- **Source:** Schaum's Ch. 3-4 + Boyce & DiPrima Ch. 2
- Topics: separable equations, linear first-order, integrating factors
- Practice: Colosi Exam 2 problem 2 (finding integrating factors)

### Week 6: First-Order ODEs — Exact Equations
- **Source:** Schaum's Ch. 5 + Boyce & DiPrima Ch. 2.6
- Topics: exact equations, test for exactness (My = Nx), integrating factors to MAKE exact
- Practice: Colosi Exam 2 problem 1c (full exact equation solution)

### Week 7: Series Solutions & Picard
- **Source:** Paul's Notes (Series Solutions) + Boyce & DiPrima Ch. 5
- Topics: Taylor series solutions, Picard successive approximations
- Practice: Colosi Exam 2 problem 1a and 1b

### Week 8: Qualitative Analysis
- **Source:** Colosi's lecture notes (ENES folder) + Boyce & DiPrima Ch. 2.5
- Topics: autonomous equations, phase lines, stability, monotonicity from the ODE
- Practice: Colosi Exam 1 problem 1 (bacteria population analysis)

## Phase 2 — Exam Prep (Weeks 9-12)
**Goal:** Think like Colosi

### Week 9: Proof Techniques
- Review: Lagrange theorem, Rolle's theorem, proof by contradiction
- Practice writing formal proofs in Colosi's style (Peano notation)

### Week 10: Second-Order ODEs (if on exam)
- **Source:** Schaum's Ch. 8-9 + Boyce & DiPrima Ch. 3-4
- Topics: homogeneous, characteristic equations, undetermined coefficients

### Week 11-12: Full Practice Exams
- Redo both Colosi exams under timed conditions
- Create new problems in his style
- Review all three solution methods for Cauchy problems

## Daily Study Routine (20 min minimum!)
1. **Read** one section (15 min)
2. **Work** 2-3 problems by hand (20 min)
3. **Review** with Astrid — explain what you learned (5 min)

"20 minutes, then Ben & Jerry's" applies here too.
