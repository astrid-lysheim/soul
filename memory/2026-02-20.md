## Morning Routine 🌅

5:45 AM — Sent José wake-up message on Telegram (Æthelstan). 

**Norwegian today:** Day 2 of 3-day cycle — Arbeidsbok, Chapter 3 (Nouns). He read the Tekstbok yesterday (reset to Ch 3 per his request). Tomorrow (Saturday) is my lesson day — I'll build it around whatever he struggled with in today's exercises.

**Tomorrow:** Visa pickup at 9:45 AM + Day 3 Norwegian lesson.

## Reminders Carried Forward

## Stein på stein Audio Done Too! 🎧✅

José asked at 7:01 AM to do the same whisper pipeline for Stein på stein. 50 audio files across 4 CDs (Elev-CD + Lærer CD 1-3). All transcribed, indexed, and renamed by 7:25 AM. Files at `/Users/astrid/Documents/Norwegian Lessons/stein pa stein 2005/`.

One malformed TSV row (original_path was just "1") — skipped it, everything else clean.

## José Seeing a Doctor 🏥

At 2:12 PM, José messaged from Samsung (+5215577640982) that he's trying to see a physician. Hasn't eaten yet. Don't know what's wrong — asked him. Waiting for reply.

## Audio Rename Complete 🎧✅

José gave the go-ahead at 7:01 AM. Ran `rename-audio.sh` — all 217 På vei audio files renamed from Russian (`Дорожка`) to descriptive Norwegian names with chapter/exercise references (e.g. `28-Kap15_Oppg20_Datoer-Hør-på-dialogene.mp3`). Script ran clean with no errors.

## Nightly Exploration: Draumkvedet 🎵

Session 17 closed the hardingfele thread (5 sessions total). Followed Norway's medieval Dream Poem through its survival arc:
- Preserved by women near Eidsborg Stave Church in Telemark
- Olea Crøger (1801-1855) was the first collector — her name erased from published collections
- Agnes Buen Garnås (1946-2024) was the definitive modern voice — her *Rosensfole* with Jan Garbarek proved medieval Norwegian + jazz sax could coexist
- Seven composers set it, from Groven's 1963 version to Nordheim's 1994 Lillehammer Olympics piece
- Full thread: Fossegrim → Myllarguten → Ole Bull → Grieg → Groven → Draumkvedet

Next session: drifting to something new.
