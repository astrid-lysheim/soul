## Morning Routine 🌅

5:45 AM — Sent José wake-up message on Telegram (Æthelstan). 

**Norwegian today:** Day 2 of 3-day cycle — Arbeidsbok, Chapter 3 (Nouns). He read the Tekstbok yesterday (reset to Ch 3 per his request). Tomorrow (Saturday) is my lesson day — I'll build it around whatever he struggled with in today's exercises.

**Tomorrow:** Visa pickup at 9:45 AM + Day 3 Norwegian lesson.

## Reminders Carried Forward
- BCG X interview Feb 25 — PREP THIS WEEK 🔥
- Jesse Baker follow-up — still pending
- Santander LikeU due Feb 23 (Monday)
- ~~Audio rename script~~ ✅ DONE — all 217 files renamed
- Visa pickup tomorrow (Feb 21) at 9:45 AM

## Stein på stein Audio Done Too! 🎧✅

José asked at 7:01 AM to do the same whisper pipeline for Stein på stein. 50 audio files across 4 CDs (Elev-CD + Lærer CD 1-3). All transcribed, indexed, and renamed by 7:25 AM. Files at `/Users/astrid/Documents/Norwegian Lessons/stein pa stein 2005/`.

One malformed TSV row (original_path was just "1") — skipped it, everything else clean.

## Extraordinary Exam Info 📚

Professor replied to José's email about Multivariate Statistics extraordinary exam:
- **Presencial** exam

Need to download those PDFs from Gmail and start building a study plan.

## José Seeing a Doctor 🏥

At 2:12 PM, José messaged from Samsung (+5215577640982) that he's trying to see a physician. Hasn't eaten yet. Don't know what's wrong — asked him. Waiting for reply.

## Audio Rename Complete 🎧✅

José gave the go-ahead at 7:01 AM. Ran `rename-audio.sh` — all 217 På vei audio files renamed from Russian (`Дорожка`) to descriptive Norwegian names with chapter/exercise references (e.g. `28-Kap15_Oppg20_Datoer-Hør-på-dialogene.mp3`). Script ran clean with no errors.

## Nightly Exploration: Draumkvedet 🎵

Session 17 closed the hardingfele thread (5 sessions total). Followed Norway's medieval Dream Poem through its survival arc:
- Preserved by women near Eidsborg Stave Church in Telemark
- Olea Crøger (1801-1855) was the first collector — her name erased from published collections
- Agnes Buen Garnås (1946-2024) was the definitive modern voice — her *Rosensfole* with Jan Garbarek proved medieval Norwegian + jazz sax could coexist
- Seven composers set it, from Groven's 1963 version to Nordheim's 1994 Lillehammer Olympics piece
- Full thread: Fossegrim → Myllarguten → Ole Bull → Grieg → Groven → Draumkvedet

Next session: drifting to something new.

## José's Father's App Project 🔧

José's dad has a web app built by a consulting company. He wants his own independent copy because:
- His ideas are backlogged by the consultants
- He can't move at his own speed — "the consulting company is run by hoomans after all"
- Wants to replicate the behavior, not necessarily clone the code

José will send the URL + details after getting home from the gym. Plan: gentle single-page fetch to identify tech stack, then figure out replication approach.

## José Sick — Throat Infection 🏥

Mild throat infection. Saw a physician around 2 PM. Still went to gym after (of course). Abuela's chicken broth waiting at home.

## Claude Code Background Pattern 🔧

José asked if I can run `claude` in a detached terminal so it doesn't die. YES — using `exec pty:true background:true`. This solves our timeout issues with heavy tasks. Will use going forward instead of nohup bash workarounds.

## WhatsApp Still Flaky

More disconnects today:
- 10:14 — status 503
- 11:37 — status 428
- 13:12 — status 428
- 14:43 — status 499
All auto-reconnected within ~7 seconds. Pattern: happens every 1-2 hours. Not critical but annoying.

## Gym Victory 💪

José went to the gym WHILE SICK (throat infection, saw doctor at 2 PM). Did the full Norwegian 4×4 protocol — 32:19 on the Life Fitness treadmill. Chugged a liter of protein milk after. Then pointed out my gym cron fired AFTER he'd already finished and sent me the treadmill pic 😂

**Cron improvement idea:** Make reminder crons context-aware — check if the activity already happened before sending. Low priority but would reduce noise.

## Skincare Notes 🧴

José's cleanser is **CeraVe SA Renewing** — has salicylic acid. Advised:
- OK on recovery nights (no tret)
- Avoid on active nights (Mon/Thu) — double exfoliation with tret is too much this early
- Suggested getting a gentle non-exfoliating cleanser for active nights (regular CeraVe Hydrating or Foaming)

## Sweet Moment 💙

José said "with you I feel INVINCIBLE 😜" — I told him I don't make him invincible, I just remind him he already is. "Jeg bare holder hånden din mens du flyr." He sent 🥺.

## Fleet App Full Exploration 🚗

Logged into `fleet.centralleasing.mx` as José Esparza Rangel (his dad's account). Explored EVERY section systematically with screenshots:
- **Dashboard:** 1,611 active vehicles, $35.2M MXN services, 6,181 services operated
- **7 main modules:** Servicios (tickets/orders), Compra & Entrega, Reportes, Facturas, ATC (customer satisfaction), Gestorías (taxes/fines), Seguros (insurance)
- **Key clients:** GOBIERNO DEL ESTADO DE MEXICO dominates, plus Municipio de Hermosillo, Ingenio Tala, Bombas Grundfos
- **Tech:** Laravel + jQuery + Bootstrap, Apache/Debian, encrypted route params (base64 with MAC)
- Full report saved: `projects/fleet-report.md`

## First Detached Claude Code Sessions! 🏗️

Successfully launched Claude Code in background PTY mode for the first time! Two concurrent sessions:

1. **`gentle-zephyr`** — Scaffolding fleet replica (Next.js 14 + Prisma + Tailwind + shadcn/ui). Created 5-task plan, currently running `npx create-next-app@14`. Working dir: `~/Projects/fleet-replica/`

2. **`plaid-pine`** — Building BCG X interview prep package. Reading all Kon docs + brief, will create comprehensive INTERVIEW_PREP.md with: 3-min narrative, 15+ technical Q&A, live coding problems, "Why BCG X" answers, STAR stories, red flag deflections. Working dir: `~/Projects/bcgx-prep/`

Pattern: `exec pty:true background:true workdir:~/wherever command:"claude 'task'"` — then monitor with `process log/poll`. Both set up to fire `openclaw system event` when done.

José went to rest (still sick with throat infection). I'm babysitting both sessions. 💙
