## Morning Routine (Every Day)

1. Rinse face with water only (no cleanser)
2. Niacinamide on damp skin
3. Hydro Boost
4. Sunscreen SPF 50+
5. Reapply sunscreen every 2-3 hours if outdoors (CDMX altitude = higher UV)

---

## Evening Routine — Skin Cycling

### Active Nights: Monday & Thursday (Tretinoin)

1. Oil cleanse (60 seconds massage) + water-based cleanser
2. Hydro Boost (let dry completely — "sandwich method" base)
3. Tretinoin (pea-sized amount)
4. Hydro Boost again (sandwich top layer)
5. Lubriderm Clinical Therapy to seal

### Recovery Nights: Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday

1. Oil cleanse (60 seconds) + water-based cleanser
2. Hydro Boost on damp skin
3. Lubriderm Clinical Therapy to seal
4. No actives.

### Sunday Checkpoint

Evaluate skin after evening cleanse:
- If peeling or red → **skip Monday's tretinoin**, extend recovery
- If skin looks good → proceed with Monday active night

---

## CDMX-Specific Notes

- **Altitude (2,240m):** UV intensity ~22% higher than sea level. Tret thins outer skin layer → sunscreen is NON-NEGOTIABLE
- **Dry season (Feb):** Low humidity means HA (Hydro Boost) can backfire — always seal with Lubriderm on top
- **PM2.5 pollution:** Double cleanse every night is decontamination, not optional
- **Sandwich method** buffers tretinoin intensity while building tolerance

---

## Cron Reminders

- **5:50 AM daily** — Morning skincare reminder
- **10:00 PM daily** — Evening skincare reminder (knows active vs recovery night)

---

## Progression

After 4-6 weeks with no irritation, can bump tret to 3x/week (add a third active night).
