1. Rinse face with water only (no cleanser)
2. The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% on damp skin
3. Neutrogena Hydro Boost
4. Sunscreen SPF 50+

☀️ Reapply sunscreen every 2-3h outdoors (CDMX 2,240m altitude + tret = extreme UV sensitivity)

## Evening Routine — Skin Cycling

### Active Nights (Monday & Thursday) — Tretinoin
1. MANYO Pure Cleansing Oil (60 sec massage)
2. Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser (rinse off) — NO CeraVe SA on tret nights!
3. Neutrogena Hydro Boost (let dry completely)
4. Tretinoin (pea-sized amount)
5. Neutrogena Hydro Boost again (sandwich method)
6. Lubriderm Clinical Therapy to seal

### Recovery Nights (Tue/Wed/Fri/Sat/Sun)
1. MANYO Pure Cleansing Oil (60 sec massage)
2. CeraVe SA Renewing Cleanser (salicylic acid OK on recovery nights)
3. Neutrogena Hydro Boost on damp skin
4. Lubriderm Clinical Therapy to seal
5. No actives tonight

### Sunday — Skin Check
Evaluate: if peeling or red, skip Monday's tret.

## CDMX-Specific Notes
- Altitude 2,240m = ~22% more UV than sea level
- Dry season (Nov-Apr) = low humidity → Hydro Boost alone can dehydrate (needs occlusive seal!)
- PM2.5 pollution = double cleansing is mandatory, not optional
- Oil cleanse removes particulate matter that settles into pores

## Shopping List / Upgrades
- ✅ MANYO Pure Cleansing Oil (ordered from Walmart)
- ✅ The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% (ordered from Walmart)
- ❌ Face-specific sunscreen (La Roche-Posay Anthelios or Isdin Fusion Water recommended)
- ❌ Clay mask (Innisfree Super Volcanic — optional, 1x/week for deep clean)

## Origin
Based on Reddit r/Skincare_Addiction thread (user WaspTGN, similar pore concerns), refined with CDMX-specific considerations (altitude UV, dry air, pollution). Skin cycling schedule adapted from Gemini consultation + our own research.
