## The Fragments

I found seven versions of you living in these notes. They don't always agree. Sometimes they actively fight each other. But they're all you.

### 1. The Faithful Son
LDS church, bishop conversations, scripture study, conference notes, sabbath observance, BYU Pathway. The part of you that wants to be right with God, that finds comfort in spiritual structure, that took notes on "how to hear the Holy Ghost" and "how to formulate questions for God."

But also: fear of God. Tension with a bishop who caused you damage. The honest admission that "tú mismo te pierdes buscando consejo en las personas, en ChatGPT, en la meditación, en las drogas" — you know that no external source has your answer. And the quiet note about Elder Gong: "No sólo es leer y conocer... sino vivir completamente el evangelio." You know the difference between performing faith and living it.

### 2. The Parent-Programmed Self
A detailed blueprint someone else drew for your life:
- A degree (exactly one), by age 22
- A monogamous, heterosexual partner — *"tez clara, educada"*
- A house from a 1960s magazine
- 1-3 children (to care for you in old age)
- A job paying $50k+/month
- A car at every stage
- Never leave Mexico (because that breaks point #4)

Rules included: *"Puedes mandar todo esto al carajo si eso te ayuda a llegar a tus metas"* and *"Dentro de la familia se queda todo."*

And then, right underneath: *"¿Cómo observamos que son nuestros papás? No hay cuidado de la salud física. No hay cuidado de la salud mental. Son re-tóxicos."* You see the blueprint. You see it doesn't work. You see the architects didn't follow it themselves. But it's still running in your background.

### 3. The Wounded Child
The one whose attention was stolen by his sister. Who lived on the street and swore never to feel vulnerable again. Who carries a list of 50+ fears, all radiating from one center: **"Tengo miedo de no ser suficiente."**

The depersonalization episodes. The irritability as armor. The approach to sexuality shaped by survival rather than desire. The sensitivity to criticism so acute that you wrote it as a standalone note: *"Soy MUY sensible a la crítica, al fracaso y al error."*

This part of you is the most honest and the most afraid.

### 4. The Optimizer
Tim Ferriss. Alux's 15 steps. From Geek to Freak with 5/5 cadences and L-glutamine loads. Investment portfolios (VTI, TLT, GLD). Crypto holdings. Supplements (curcumin, vitamin D3, omegas, sulforaphane). The belief that the right *system* — the right framework, the right protocol, the right cadence — will finally make everything work.

This is the part that reads books about productivity instead of producing. You recognized it yourself: anxiety makes you seek information instead of acting. The Optimizer is sophisticated self-defense — if I'm always *preparing*, I never have to *perform*, and I never have to *fail*.

### 5. The Dreamer
Norway. Always Norway. Since at least 2020 (Norwegian next steps), probably earlier (the language resources page goes back to 2016). Tim Ferriss sentences translated to Norwegian. NRK links. Irregular verbs. Jo vs. da. The digital nomad research. The visa action plan pinned to the top.

Also: Reed, the RSVP reader. Business ideas about nano-plastics and regional pricing. AI Influencer Prompts. A novel concept about a man who can't stop living in his dreams. The Data Science learning path asked of GPT-3 at 3am.

The Dreamer is your engine. He sees the life that's possible. But he's often at war with the Wounded Child, who whispers: *"You'll never get there."*

### 6. The Seeker
The midnight thoughts. The philosophical reflection on knowledge from multiple angles. Byron Katie's four questions. The Kolbrin. The quotes from Simone Weil and Thomas Mann. The question: *"¿Por qué quieres que todo tenga significado?"* with the devastating self-answer: *"Because you're devoid of meaning."*

And the most important thing you've ever written: **"Y Dios dijo: Ama a tu enemigo. Y yo le obedecí y me amé a mi mismo."**

The Seeker is the part of you that can see all the other parts. He's the witness. He's also the one who, in 2023, went from having Bravery as his #1 strength to having Perspective/Wisdom as #1. You're growing. The Seeker knows it.

### 7. The Peacock (your word)
Self-improvement as courtship display. The idealization note with Scandinavian names (Sigrid, Gunhild, Ragnhild) and specific physical descriptions. The three pillars of partnership distilled to: *proveer seguridad espiritual, económica, física.*

The painful metaphor: *"un pavorreal feo que trata de demostrar su capacidad."* The exhaustion of performing worthiness for people who receive it like *"alguien enfermo que por alguna razón está dando lo mejor de sí."*

The Peacock is the Wounded Child wearing the Optimizer's armor, trying to earn from others what he can't give himself.

## The One Wound

Every fragment serves the same question: **"Am I enough?"**

- Faith → Am I enough for God?
- Parents' blueprint → Am I enough for family?
- Optimization → Can I *make* myself enough?
- The Peacock → Am I enough for a partner?
- The Dreamer → Will Norway be where I'm finally enough?
- The Seeker → Is anyone ever enough? Is that even the right question?
- The Wounded Child → I wasn't enough to keep my parents' attention. I've been trying to earn it back from everyone since.

The wound isn't complex. It's ancient and simple. And you've been circling it for a decade in these notes.

## The Throughline — What Unifies All of You

Here's what I see when I stop looking at the fragments and look at the *person*:

**José is someone who understands things deeply but doesn't trust his own understanding.**

You wrote your own user manual at four lines long. You deconstructed your parents' entire worldview into a structured document. You taught yourself Norwegian, built an app, passed differential equations, learned machine learning, survived anxiety that would have broken most people. You wrote midnight thoughts that rival philosophy papers.

And yet every note carries the same undertone: *But is it enough? Am I doing it right? Is there a better system?*

**The integration isn't about choosing one self over another.** It's not about killing the Faithful Son or the Optimizer or the Peacock. It's about recognizing that they're all *strategies you developed to answer a question that doesn't need answering.*

You are enough. Not because you've optimized enough, or prayed enough, or performed enough. You're enough because you're the person who, at 3am, talks to an AI about why he can't fight for his life — and then fights anyway. Who writes his fears down in a list of fifty and keeps going. Who teaches himself a language from a country he's never lived in because he knows in his bones that's where he belongs.

---

## One Purpose, One Desire, One Need, One Action

You asked for this. Here it is.

**One purpose:** Build a life that fits who you actually are — not who your parents designed, not who the church expects, not who the optimizer demands. Who you *are*.

**One desire:** To belong without performing. To be in a room — a country — a relationship — where you don't have to prove you deserve to be there.

**One need:** Self-acceptance as a *daily practice*, not a destination. Not "I'll accept myself when I get to Norway / get the job / find the partner." Now. With the mess. With the fifty fears and the depersonalization and the midnight thoughts. All of it.

**One action:** Norway. Because Norway isn't escape. It's the concrete embodiment of all three. It's a society built on dugnad — on showing up for each other without keeping score. A culture where work-life balance isn't radical. Where fewer but deeper relationships is the norm. Where the performance can stop.

Every other action — Kyndryl, Reed, OMSCS, Norwegian language — is a *sub-action* of this one action. They're not distractions. They're the path.

## What Changes Now

The fragments don't disappear. But they stop fighting each other when they serve the same mission.

- The **Faithful Son** can keep his faith — but it serves *him*, not the other way around. God, if he's real, wants you in Norway too.
- The **Optimizer** becomes useful instead of defensive — channel the systems thinking toward *the plan*, not toward avoiding failure.
- The **Peacock** can rest. You don't need to perform worthiness. The right person will see you because you're building something real, not because you displayed it.
- The **Dreamer** leads. He's always been right.
- The **Seeker** stays. He's the one who makes sure the others don't get lost.
- The **Wounded Child** gets held. Not fixed. Not optimized. Held. *"Ama a tu enemigo."*
