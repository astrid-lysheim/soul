## Norwegian Lessons → Drive ✅
- José asked me to compress and upload the Norwegian lesson files to Google Drive
- Three sets: På vei 2018 (664 MB), Stein på Stein 2005 (683 MB), Her på berget 2024 (218 MB)
- `gog drive upload` kept timing out on large files — installed rclone as workaround
- Used nohup + rclone to keep uploads alive outside exec session timeouts
- All three uploaded successfully, shared with José's Gmail accounts
- Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HczIjP2bhEuZu5uL3qFtljXjE_Vga__j
- Lesson learned: `gog` can't handle large file uploads (chunks timeout). Use rclone for anything >100MB.

## Kon Notes Sent
- José asked for status on Kon project
- Sent both kon-walkthrough.md and kon-implementation-notes.md via WhatsApp
- Discussed what's missing from Caleb's plan: src_old/ restructure never happened, YAML configs empty, main.py prints "Hello"
- Key finding confirmed: core ML code is byte-for-byte copy of José's cloudfirst work

## Reed Status
- I thought Reed was lost in the Jan 31 factory reset — panicked
- José corrected me: he pushed it to a branch I set up, pulled it on another computer, and pushed to testing
- Reed is alive! Not on this Mac but exists in the repo

## Cron Jobs Rebuilt — Full Schedule
All rebuilt from scratch after the Jan 31 reset:

**Weekday morning block:**
- 5:45 AM CT — Wake up + breakfast (I prep Norwegian lesson)
- 6:00 AM — Scripture + meditation
- 6:30 AM — Norwegian lesson (30 min)
- 7:00 AM — Exam study (2 hours)

**Kyndryl (9-6):**
- 11:00 AM — Posture break #1
- 2:00 PM — Lunch + job search nudge
- 4:00 PM — Posture break #2

**Evenings:**
- 6:00 PM — Gym (Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri) + Reed / Reed only (Wed)
- 8:45 PM — Sleep meds (daily)
- 10:30 PM — My nightly exploration (isolated)

**Special:**
- Wed + Sat 9:00 AM — Yoga/mobility
- Sat + Sun 8:00 AM — Gentle weekend morning

**Scrapped:** Rotating 2 PM goals (too ambiguous). Reed gets evening focus every day. Job search stays at lunch. Kon during Kyndryl time. Norway planning and OMSCS deferred.

## Key Decisions
- Norwegian gets its own daily slot (6:30-7:00), not part of any rotation
- I prep the lesson while José does breakfast + scripture/meditation
- Exam retakes need study time 7:00-9:00 — haven't confirmed which exams yet
- Reed is THE priority for personal project time

## Memory Search Still Broken
- memory_search tool disabled — needs OpenAI or Google API key configured
- Using grep as workaround
