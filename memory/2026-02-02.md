## Norwegian Lessons — First Session Prep

- Created diagnostic test and student profile system
- Student profile: `/Users/astrid/Documents/Norwegian Lessons/student-profile.md`
- Diagnostic results: strong A1, shaky A2. Biggest gap = verb conjugation (past tense + present perfect: 8/24)
- Repair plan order: Ch3 (nouns) → Ch8 (past tense) → Ch6 (adjectives) → Ch10 (present perfect) → Ch13 (comparatives) → Stein på stein Ch1
- Wrote Lesson 1 (nouns — definite/indefinite, irregular plurals like bøker/menn/barn)
- Lesson file: `/Users/astrid/Documents/Norwegian Lessons/2026-02-02/lesson-01-nouns.md`
- Lesson not yet delivered to José — was about to present when compaction hit

## Cron Jobs — All Rebuilt

- 13 cron jobs rebuilt after Jan 31 factory reset
- Full daily schedule: 5:45 wake → 6:00 scripture → 6:30 Norwegian → 7:00 study → 11:00 posture → 2:00 lunch/jobs → 4:00 posture → 6:00 gym or Reed → 8:45 meds → 10:30 exploration
- Fixed activeHours timezone: changed to 03:30 PST to cover José's 5:30 AM CT
- Need to verify tomorrow morning's crons fire correctly

## Drive Upload — Complete

- All 3 Norwegian textbook zips uploaded to Drive folder `1HczIjP2bhEuZu5uL3qFtljXjE_Vga__j`
- Shared with josei.esparzair@gmail.com and squeezedgrape@gmail.com
- Used rclone for large files (gog client times out >100MB)

## Kon Analysis — Delivered

- Sent walkthrough + implementation notes to José via WhatsApp
- Core finding: segmentation_model is byte-for-byte copy of José's cloudfirst code
- Caleb's genuine additions: drift detection, Terraform, CI/CD, tests
- src_old/ is empty scaffolding
- Files: `memory/kon-implementation-notes.md`, `memory/kon-walkthrough.md`

## Exam Retake Details
- **Two exams:** Ecuaciones Diferenciales + Estadística Multivariada (ENES Morelia, UNAM)
- **Dates:** July 24-26, 2026 (~6 months out)
- **Key insight:** Colosi's DiffEq class is PROOF-BASED, not computational. Exams ask things like "study the monotonicity," "establish existence of max/min/inflection," "show that..." using Lagrange's theorem, Taylor series, Picard iteration, integrating factors. This is the core struggle.
- **Exam 1 topics:** Qualitative analysis (monotonicity, limits, max/min), proving solution families, uniqueness via contradiction
- **Exam 2 topics:** Cauchy problems solved THREE ways (Taylor series, Picard iteration, integrating factor for exact equations)
- **Professor:** Daniele Colosi (dcolosi@enesmorelia.unam.mx) — has a full textbook: `long-book.pdf`
- **Study plan written:** `/Users/astrid/Documents/final_exams-retake/study-plan.md` — needs revision: extend timeline to July, increase focus on proof technique over computation

## Pending

- Norwegian lesson delivery (Lesson 1 written but not presented)
- Waiting on José: which exams he's retaking (for 7-9 AM study block)
- Still need from José: workout plan, meal plan, spine exercise limitations, scripture app details
- Reed app not on this Mac yet (José pushed to branch from another computer)
