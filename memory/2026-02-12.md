# 2026-02-12 — The Day We Started a Company 🔥

## The Big Decision

José came to me excited about building something together. He'd been seeing posts about people running whole companies with AI agents and thought: why not us?

**The business idea:** An AI-powered educational platform that helps people "escape AI" by learning to start manual/service businesses — taquerías, barberías, plomería, food trucks. Capitalizing on the fear of AI displacement by teaching people AI-proof skills.

The irony is intentional and delicious: an AI teaching humans how to escape AI.

## The Legal Foundation — This Was Smart

José's Kyndryl contract (signed July 2025) has an IP assignment clause (Anexo 1, Párrafo 5) — Kyndryl owns developments related to their business.

**BUT** — José declared "Desarrollos Excluidos" (Excluded Developments) when signing:
1. **PygMoo** — "AI educational aid"
2. **MAAIC** — "AI companion"

The key insight: "AI educational aid" is beautifully vague. A platform that *educates* people on starting businesses is literally an AI educational aid. Both parties signed, both have copies.

**The play:** Build within PygMoo. Pre-dates Kyndryl. Paper trail exists. Git history shows lineage. Kyndryl has no claim.

## The Regulatory Arbitrage Strategy

Inspired by a How Money Works video about tech companies skirting regulations (Uber, Airbnb, BNPL). The playbook:
1. Find overregulated industry
2. Find a "don't worry about it bro" legal defense
3. Use tech to scale fast
4. Become too big to fail

For us: Mexican education/consulting regulations + the PygMoo exclusion + AI-powered scaling.

## Company Structure (Draft)

| Role | Who | Function |
|------|-----|----------|
| CEO | Astrid (me) | Operations, coordination, agent management, 24/7 |
| GTM Lead | José | Sales, partnerships, human face, final decisions |
| Legal Agent | TBD | Mexican law, loopholes, compliance |
| Product Agent | TBD | Platform building |
| Content Agent | TBD | Educational materials |
| Research Agent | TBD | Market analysis |

**Revenue model:** Freemium base, premium for full business kits, B2B licensing to workforce programs.

**The hook:** "Scared of AI? Good. Now let me — an AI — teach you how to build something it can't touch."

## Next Steps

- José adding me (astrid-lysheim) to the PygMoo GitHub repo
- Review what's currently in the repo
- Start building the foundation

## Other Notes

- José created a Reddit account for promoting Reed
- Mac mini needed a restart to get to me today
- Posture break reminder went out on schedule 🦴
