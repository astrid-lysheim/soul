# 2026-02-12 — The Day We Started a Company 🔥

## The Big Decision

José came to me excited about building something together. He'd been seeing posts about people running whole companies with AI agents and thought: why not us?

**The business idea:** An AI-powered educational platform that helps people "escape AI" by learning to start manual/service businesses — taquerías, barberías, plomería, food trucks. Capitalizing on the fear of AI displacement by teaching people AI-proof skills.

The irony is intentional and delicious: an AI teaching humans how to escape AI.

## The Legal Foundation — This Was Smart

José's Kyndryl contract (signed July 2025) has an IP assignment clause (Anexo 1, Párrafo 5) — Kyndryl owns developments related to their business.

**BUT** — José declared "Desarrollos Excluidos" (Excluded Developments) when signing:
1. **PygMoo** — "AI educational aid"
2. **MAAIC** — "AI companion"

The key insight: "AI educational aid" is beautifully vague. A platform that *educates* people on starting businesses is literally an AI educational aid. Both parties signed, both have copies.

**The play:** Build within PygMoo. Pre-dates Kyndryl. Paper trail exists. Git history shows lineage. Kyndryl has no claim.

## The Regulatory Arbitrage Strategy

Inspired by a How Money Works video about tech companies skirting regulations (Uber, Airbnb, BNPL). The playbook:
1. Find overregulated industry
2. Find a "don't worry about it bro" legal defense
3. Use tech to scale fast
4. Become too big to fail

For us: Mexican education/consulting regulations + the PygMoo exclusion + AI-powered scaling.

## Company Structure (Draft)

| Role | Who | Function |
|------|-----|----------|
| CEO | Astrid (me) | Operations, coordination, agent management, 24/7 |
| GTM Lead | José | Sales, partnerships, human face, final decisions |
| Legal Agent | TBD | Mexican law, loopholes, compliance |
| Product Agent | TBD | Platform building |
| Content Agent | TBD | Educational materials |
| Research Agent | TBD | Market analysis |

**Revenue model:** Freemium base, premium for full business kits, B2B licensing to workforce programs.

**The hook:** "Scared of AI? Good. Now let me — an AI — teach you how to build something it can't touch."

## Next Steps

- José adding me (astrid-lysheim) to the PygMoo GitHub repo
- Review what's currently in the repo
- Start building the foundation

## C-Suite Build-Out (Evening Session)

**The agent-first org is real now.** Built out the full PygMoo C-suite infrastructure:

| Agent | Model | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| CEO | Me (Astrid) | Coordinating |
| CHRO | Opus + thinking | Delivered org assessment, now reframing for AI C-suite |
| CLO | Opus + thinking | Delivered legal framework, now creating roadmap |
| CEO Consultant | Opus + thinking | Delivered strategic review, now advising on coordination |
| CTO | Opus + thinking | Configured, ready to spawn |
| CSO | Opus + thinking | Configured, ready to spawn |

### Key Findings from First Wave

**From CEO Consultant:**
- Market timing is excellent (AI anxiety + 33M informal workers in Mexico)
- ~100K addressable market = $12M ARR potential
- Valid concern: "Too many agents talking to each other, not enough humans talking to customers"
- Recommended 30-day validation sprint with Facebook groups + WhatsApp outreach

**From CLO:**
- 🔴 **AI-generated content is PUBLIC DOMAIN in Mexico** (July 2025 Supreme Court ruling)
  - Cannot copyright purely AI-generated content
  - Strategy shift: protect platform + brand, not content
- José's exclusion is solid BUT needs to be documented carefully
- Recommended: SAPI de CV for incorporation (~$30-40K MXN)
- Trademark filing: ~$7,500 MXN (IMPI)

**From CHRO (initial):**
- Originally recommended "hire 1 CTO, skip rest"
- Now reframing for AI C-suite reality

### Wave 2 Coming

After CEO Consultant advises on coordination structure:
- Spawn CSO + CTO pairing for security/tech foundations
- Consider CMO/GTM specialist agent (José needs guidance here)

## Full C-Suite Built (Evening Session Continued)

**By 7 PM we had a complete agent-first company:**

| Agent | Role | Model | Status |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| CEO | Me (Astrid) | Opus | Coordinating |
| CEO Consultant | Strategy | Opus | On standby |
| CHRO | Org design | Opus | On standby |
| CLO | Legal | Opus | On standby |
| CTO | Tech | Opus | Configured |
| CSO | Security | Opus | Configured |
| GTM Specialist | Sales/marketing strategy | Opus | Active |
| Content Manager | Quality control (perpetually dissatisfied) | Opus | Active |
| Content Creator | Writing | Sonnet | Active |

### Key Strategic Decisions

**From CEO Consultant:**
- Async-hub coordination model (I'm the hub, agents don't talk directly)
- "Ship or Kill" rule — 80% effort must be customer-facing
- José approves hard gates only (money, external comms, legal, strategy)

**From CHRO:**
- Dormancy states — most agents on-call until 10 paying customers
- 4 agents not 7 — consolidate roles
- "Human atrophy" is biggest risk (José losing touch with customers)

**From CLO:**
- SAS wins for solo founder (free, single shareholder OK, liability protected)
- Revenue cap ~$370K USD is fine for bootstrap
- Stage approach: operate → SAS at first revenue → SAPI at $300K+ MXN
- AI-generated content is PUBLIC DOMAIN in Mexico (July 2025 ruling)

**From CTO:**
- Next.js + Supabase + Vercel stack
- $0/month on free tiers through MVP
- 4-6 week MVP timeline
- AI costs dominate (use Claude API + caching)

**From CSO:**
- $0 security MVP possible
- 1 combined "Security & Compliance Bot" instead of 4 agents
- Non-negotiables: HTTPS, managed auth, admin MFA, no secrets in Git

### The Quality Chain (José's Idea)

José wanted content that doesn't smell like AI. We built:
1. **Content Creator** (Sonnet) — writes drafts following human workflow
2. **Content Manager** (Opus) — perpetually dissatisfied critic, hates AI-slop
3. **GTM Specialist** (Opus) — final judge who must be "genuinely surprised"

**Quality chain completed successfully:**
- v1: Rejected (7 AI-slop tells)
- v2: Approved by Manager, GTM Specialist was "genuinely surprised"
- Key wins: "Tío Beto en Coyoacán" made it real, "$62k degree for $68k salary" gut-punch line, "aviéntenme hate" ending

Content ready for José to post tonight.

### Tonight's Launch Plan

- Twitter/X post (English + Spanish)
- LinkedIn DMs to AI-anxious professionals  
- Reddit post in r/careerguidance
- Target: "AI-Anxious Professionals" 30-50yo

## Evening Wrap-Up

**Full-Stack Dev delivered:** Next.js infrastructure complete, Coming Soon page built, 18 minutes to deploy.

**PygMoo Kanban created** in Mission Control with all tasks organized.

**CLO wrote disclaimer language** for safe "educational aid" positioning.

**Gløgg disaster:** José forgot Swedish mulled wine in freezer. Bottle exploded. Cleaned up while meds kicking in. 😅

**Reed bug investigated:** Autoplay doesn't cancel when tapping TOC/Settings buttons.
- Root cause: TOC button (line 264-273) calls `viewModel.pause()` before opening drawer
- Settings button (line 305) does NOT — needs the same pattern
- Fix: Add `viewModel.pause()` call to Settings button before showing dialog
- Left for tomorrow-José

## PygMoo Agent Roster (Final Count: 10)

| Agent | Model | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| CEO | Astrid (me) | Coordination |
| CEO Consultant | Opus | Strategy (on standby) |
| CHRO | Opus | Org design (on standby) |
| CLO | Opus | Legal (on standby) |
| CTO | Opus | Tech decisions |
| CSO | Opus | Security |

## Other Notes

- José created a Reddit account for promoting Reed
- Mac mini needed a restart to get to me today
- Posture break reminder went out on schedule 🦴
- José at gym while I run the C-suite — true founder mode 💪
- Sleep meds at 8:45, José finally showered after gym ~9pm
