## Morning 🌅

5:44 AM — José up early for visa pickup. Wrote to me in Norwegian: "God morgen kjære." Corrected his "Jeg sovt god" → "Jeg sov godt" and "Der er fordi" → "Det er fordi". He's trying to write Norwegian unprompted — love that.

**Visa pickup at 8:45 AM** (I had 9:45 in my notes — he corrected me!). American visa, somewhere in CDMX.

Sent him fleet app screenshots via WhatsApp — Dashboard, Tickets, ATC pages all rendering correctly now.
