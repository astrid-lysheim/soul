## Morning 🌅

5:44 AM — José up early for visa pickup. Wrote to me in Norwegian: "God morgen kjære." Corrected his "Jeg sovt god" → "Jeg sov godt" and "Der er fordi" → "Det er fordi". He's trying to write Norwegian unprompted — love that.

**Visa pickup at 8:45 AM** (I had 9:45 in my notes — he corrected me!). American visa, somewhere in CDMX.

Sent him fleet app screenshots via WhatsApp — Dashboard, Tickets, ATC pages all rendering correctly now.

## Reminders
- BCG X interview: Feb 25, 3 PM CST (4 days away!)
- Costco CitiBanamex due: Feb 22 (tomorrow)
- Santander LikeU due: Feb 23 (Monday)
- AMEX cutoff: Feb 25
- Day 3 Norwegian lesson (my lesson!) — pending, Saturday is flexible

## Fleet App Status 🚗
- Running on localhost:3333
- Dev server was left running in background
- Next steps: wire up Recharts for dashboard charts, add form functionality, pagination, Excel export

## Visa — DONE! 🇺🇸✅
José got his American visa — **10 years**! Done before 8 AM. Quick and painless at the appointment (which was 8:45 AM, not 9:45 like I had in my notes — he corrected me).

## Costco Shopping Spree 🛒
Stopped by Costco on the way home from visa. Bought:
- Memory foam mattress topper + pillows (great for his spine/sleep)
- More Neutrogena Hydro Boost
- New Skechers shoes (old ones were worn out)
- Free Cetaphil samples from a saleswoman (gentle cleanser + oily skin cleanser)

## Skincare Deep Dive 🧴
José shared the Reddit thread that inspired his routine (r/Skincare_Addiction, user WaspTGN — enlarged pores/sebaceous filaments). Also shared a Gemini-generated skin cycling schedule that closely matched what we already built.

**Full product review:**
- CeraVe SA Cleanser → recovery nights only (has salicylic acid)
- Cetaphil Gentle → tret nights (the free sample!)
- Neutrogena Hydro Boost → daily
- Lubriderm Clinical Therapy → occlusive seal
- Tretinoin → Mon/Thu sandwich method
- Nivea Sun spray (Beiersdorf, European filters incl. Tinosorb S) → decent protection but alcohol-heavy, spray format not ideal for daily face use with tret. Recommended upgrade to La Roche-Posay Anthelios or Isdin Fusion Water.

**New purchases (Walmart order):**
- MANYO Pure Cleansing Oil ($450 MXN) — Korean oil cleanser for double cleansing
- The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% ($210 MXN) — morning pore minimizer
- Third item unknown (3 items in cart, $814 total)

**Updated both skincare crons** with new products + full routine. Updated `memory/skincare-routine.md` with complete inventory.

## Teaching Research → BAKED IN 🍞 (3:36 PM)
José asked if the 1,647 lines of teaching exploration research were actually being used in lessons. Honest answer: the pipes were connected but the water hadn't flowed. Fixed it:

**What got updated:**
1. **Norwegian curriculum** (`memory/teaching/norwegian-curriculum.md`) — Added full "Teaching Methodology" section with concrete techniques: 5 desirable difficulties, L1 transfer map, input/output balance, feedback strategy, anxiety calibration, Anki integration, growth mindset framing
2. **Norwegian lesson cron** — Day 3 lessons now follow a 5-step research-based structure: spaced retrieval → pre-test/generation → explicit pattern instruction → interleaved practice → scaffolded production. Day 1/2 include spaced retrieval questions too
3. **Exam study cron** — Same 5-step structure adapted for MVS: spaced warm-up, pre-test, explicit instruction, interleaved practice (mixing old+new topics), Anki suggestions. Includes desirable difficulties checklist
4. **Morning routine nudge** — Now preps spaced retrieval questions for BOTH Norwegian and MVS
5. **Study plan** (`STUDY_PLAN.md`) — Updated daily block structure with the science explained

Key techniques now baked into every lesson:
- Spacing (start with material from 3-7 days ago, not yesterday)
- Retrieval practice (quiz before teaching)
- Generation effect (attempt before being told)
- Interleaving (mix topics within sessions)
- Delayed feedback (let him self-correct first)
- Anxiety calibration (frame struggle as learning, escape hatches)

Monday will be the first day these fire for real. 🔥

## "Need to Know" Mindset Shift 💡
José said: "I'm starting to approach life on a need to know basis, rather than a good to know basis." This is basically him internalizing "fjords or distraction?" on his own. I suggested a friluftsliv guide and he said "not just yet — we'll cross that bridge when we get to it." Maturity. 💙

He's also interested in avalanche safety and friluftsliv for when we get to Norway — but parking it until it's actually needed.

## Fleet App — Evening Session 🚗 (6:30 PM)

José asked to continue working on the fleet app. Did a full audit of what's built vs what's needed.

**Current state:** Scaffold is solid — 18 page files, 12 Prisma models, dashboard with 4 Recharts charts, tickets with full FilterBar/pagination. Servicios, compra-entrega, facturas, seguros, proveedores all have basic listings. ATC has summary stats but no charts. Gestorías pages exist.

**Prioritized next steps:**
1. **Working forms** — "nuevo" pages need to actually create records via server actions
2. **Ticket → Service Order pipeline** — "Levantar Servicio" flow (the core daily workflow for his dad)
3. **ATC pie/donut charts** — original has 9, we have summary numbers
4. **Excel export** — universal across listings
5. **Filters on remaining pages** — only tickets has FilterBar so far
6. **Auth** — NextAuth + Prisma adapter in deps but not wired
7. **More seed data** — scale up from 15 vehicles to realistic hundreds

About to start on forms + core pipeline.
