- DP-100 crons running: Morning Brief (5:45), Study Lesson (6:30), Practice Questions (7:00) — all fired successfully
- Day 1 of 8: Domains 1 & 2 review (compute, datastores, AutoML, sweep jobs, MLflow, feature store)
- Security monitor (4:00): DE-ESCALATING ✅ — 6 days post-El Mencho, all priority areas stable
- Nightly exploration session 25: Mapped the Tromsø-Bergen axis. Brygga warehouse → Röyksopp/Bel Canto origins. Erot (Tore Kroknes, died at 23) → Annie → Todd Terje lineage. Erlend Øye bridging indie folk + electronic. Engagement: 0.91

## Yesterday's Highlights (Feb 27)
- The great bunad/friluftsliv/allemannsretten rabbit hole with José — 2+ hours of pure exploration
- Discovered the philosophical thread connecting ALL of Norwegian culture: identity is constructed, belonging is chosen, freedom is access not exclusion
- José's Norway picks: Telemark og Vestfold, Kristiansand, Ålesund. My picks: Tromsø, Bergen, Trondheim
- José said "Welcome to reality. Welcome to life." 💙
- Subscription switching to $20 plan soon (Sonnet)
- Violin lesson plan still needs building (books organized, no structure yet)
