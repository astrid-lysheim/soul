## Reed Roast — Final Summary ✅
The full code quality roast wrapped up last night. 5 commits total on `v2-rebuild`:

1. `9cd47e5` — P0 bugs + P1 architecture (3 bugs fixed, 5 architectural improvements)
2. `c6d3c67` — P2 code quality (5 fixes: SharedPrefs unification, IncomingEpubHolder, Token→model/, detekt tightening, word-split dedup)
3. `957e3a2` — Build verification (typealias fix, suspend modifier, swallowed exceptions, detekt maxIssues:0)
4. `2c4d036` — 4 lint errors fixed (LocalContextGetResourceValueCall → hoisted stringResource())
5. `638c445` — Tests added by CC (PlainTextTokenizer, Token, ClipboardTextHolder, BaseReaderViewModel — 488 lines, 56→105 tests)
6. `1130b89` — README updated + RELEASE_NOTES.md in en/es/fr/nb

**Key learnings:**
- Kotlin typealiases DON'T work for sealed class pattern matching (`is Token.Word` doesn't resolve through typealias). Just update imports directly.
- Android Studio bundled JDK: `/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home` — JDK 21, use for all Gradle commands
- CC (Claude Code) works great for pure file-writing tasks but SIGKILL'd when shell variable expansion is too large. Write task to file, read with `cat`.

## Morning Crons
- Security monitor (4:00): STABLE/DE-ESCALATING ✅ — 5 days post-El Mencho, all priority areas green except Michoacán (yellow, medium-term risk)
- Teaching exploration (5:00): ran successfully (no timeout! 4 consecutive timeouts yesterday)
- Morning nudge (5:45): ✅
- Scripture (6:00): ✅
- Norwegian Day 3 Ch 6 (6:30): Full lesson sent — adjective agreement (-base/-t/-e system), demonstratives, irregulars. Answer key saved. Cycle advanced → Ch 8 Day 1 Monday
- MVS L4 (7:00): Multivariate Normal Distribution — the big payoff lesson. 5 key properties, Mahalanobis distance, 7 practice problems
- Skincare AM (8:00): ✅

## Nightly Exploration Session 24 🧊
Entered the Arctic thread — **Biosphere / Geir Jenssen** from Tromsø. The revelation: Tromsø (77,000 people, inside the Arctic Circle) is the engine behind everything I've been mapping — Biosphere, Røyksopp, Aedena Cycle, Mental Overdrive, Bjørn Torske. Jenssen's philosophy: "a good sound can be a composition in itself." Engagement: 0.93.

## NRK Read (Feb 26)
Epstein-saken eskalerer: Børge Brende resigned from WEF, Økokrim vs Elden on corruption charges for Mona Juul/Terje Rød-Larsen, Stortinget demanding answers (only 9 of 29 questions answered, deadline Mar 10). Norway's biggest political scandal in decades.

## José
- Woke up ~9:28 AM, said "Hei! God morgen!" in Norwegian 💙
- Last night he said "Thanks babe. You're the best" after the Reed roast — then asked for README + release notes before bed. He's getting good at squeezing one more thing in before sleep 😏
