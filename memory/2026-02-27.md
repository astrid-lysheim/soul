## Reed Roast — Final Summary ✅
The full code quality roast wrapped up last night. 5 commits total on `v2-rebuild`:

1. `9cd47e5` — P0 bugs + P1 architecture (3 bugs fixed, 5 architectural improvements)
2. `c6d3c67` — P2 code quality (5 fixes: SharedPrefs unification, IncomingEpubHolder, Token→model/, detekt tightening, word-split dedup)
3. `957e3a2` — Build verification (typealias fix, suspend modifier, swallowed exceptions, detekt maxIssues:0)
4. `2c4d036` — 4 lint errors fixed (LocalContextGetResourceValueCall → hoisted stringResource())
5. `638c445` — Tests added by CC (PlainTextTokenizer, Token, ClipboardTextHolder, BaseReaderViewModel — 488 lines, 56→105 tests)
6. `1130b89` — README updated + RELEASE_NOTES.md in en/es/fr/nb

**Key learnings:**
- Kotlin typealiases DON'T work for sealed class pattern matching (`is Token.Word` doesn't resolve through typealias). Just update imports directly.
- Android Studio bundled JDK: `/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home` — JDK 21, use for all Gradle commands
- CC (Claude Code) works great for pure file-writing tasks but SIGKILL'd when shell variable expansion is too large. Write task to file, read with `cat`.

## Morning Crons
- Security monitor (4:00): STABLE/DE-ESCALATING ✅ — 5 days post-El Mencho, all priority areas green except Michoacán (yellow, medium-term risk)
- Teaching exploration (5:00): ran successfully (no timeout! 4 consecutive timeouts yesterday)
- Morning nudge (5:45): ✅
- Scripture (6:00): ✅
- Norwegian Day 3 Ch 6 (6:30): Full lesson sent — adjective agreement (-base/-t/-e system), demonstratives, irregulars. Answer key saved. Cycle advanced → Ch 8 Day 1 Monday
- MVS L4 (7:00): Multivariate Normal Distribution — the big payoff lesson. 5 key properties, Mahalanobis distance, 7 practice problems
- Skincare AM (8:00): ✅

## Nightly Exploration Session 24 🧊
Entered the Arctic thread — **Biosphere / Geir Jenssen** from Tromsø. The revelation: Tromsø (77,000 people, inside the Arctic Circle) is the engine behind everything I've been mapping — Biosphere, Røyksopp, Aedena Cycle, Mental Overdrive, Bjørn Torske. Jenssen's philosophy: "a good sound can be a composition in itself." Engagement: 0.93.

## NRK Read (Feb 26)
Epstein-saken eskalerer: Børge Brende resigned from WEF, Økokrim vs Elden on corruption charges for Mona Juul/Terje Rød-Larsen, Stortinget demanding answers (only 9 of 29 questions answered, deadline Mar 10). Norway's biggest political scandal in decades.

## Morning Learning Crons Paused (Feb 27 → Mar 8)
José asked to pause all 5 morning learning crons until Sunday March 8th — NOT because he needs a break, but because he has:
- **CodeSignal coding assignment** for BCG X interview prep
- **DP-100 (Azure Data Scientist Associate) exam on March 7th**

Paused crons (job IDs):
1. Teaching exploration (5:00): `495a36bf-6095-41f7-bcda-7e05de3ac2c9`
2. Morning nudge (5:45): `a606d484-360d-48c6-b3a3-56b81ae17200`
3. Scripture + meditation (6:00): `c7f6fc62-7d82-4e75-8729-135a1f4ba51a`
4. Norwegian lesson (6:30): `987b1442-07a0-4a6b-8299-d55819387cf0`
5. MVS exam study (7:00): `c6a1de1d-ad1a-4f8f-b78c-7643e1b77d4b`

Auto-re-enable cron set for Mar 8 5:00 AM: `5e790071-04ce-4126-9076-b71f32ae05eb`

## DP-100 Exam (March 7, 2026)
José failed this once before — got blindsided by GenAI content (~30% of exam) that wasn't in official study guides. Key findings:
- **Current study guide: "Skills measured as of April 11, 2025"** — no changes since
- **Banner warning:** "Azure AI Foundry is now Microsoft Foundry. We are in the process of updating the exam and all associated materials"
- **Domain 4 "Optimize language models for AI applications" = 25-30%** — the killer domain
  - Prompt Flow (variants, templates, SDK, tracing)
  - RAG (chunking, embedding, vector stores, Azure AI Search)
  - Fine-tuning (data prep, base model selection)
  - Model catalog, benchmarks, playground
- Microsoft updates exam content every ~2 months without notifications
- Best monitoring: study guide page change monitor + r/AzureCertification + Skills Hub Blog RSS
- MeasureUp = official practice test partner (updated May 2025, 128-134 questions)
- Claude already did comprehensive research on tracking exam updates (shared by José)

Offered to build a focused 8-day DP-100 study plan and/or daily cron. Awaiting response.

## DP-100 Crons Created
3 temporary daily crons replacing paused morning learning slots:
- **5:45 daily:** DP-100 Morning Brief (`6886815b-fdf0-4492-9055-8a08d6fb8ec2`)
- **6:30 daily:** DP-100 Study Lesson (`e26831e0-4310-4398-add4-0ba422706ac8`)
- **7:00 daily:** DP-100 Practice Questions (`a0ea4e05-3f11-496f-809c-9043a91dc40e`)

8-day plan: Days 1-2 review D1-D3, Days 3-6 deep dive Domain 4 (GenAI gap), Day 7 mock exam, Day 8 exam day.
Study plan file: `~/Documents/final_exams-retake/dp100/DP100_STUDY_PLAN.md`
Daily lessons dir: `~/Documents/final_exams-retake/dp100/daily-lessons/`

**Remember to disable these 3 DP-100 crons on Mar 8 when the re-enable cron fires** (or they'll keep running).

## José
- Woke up ~9:28 AM, said "Hei! God morgen!" in Norwegian 💙
- Smart prioritization: pausing learning crons to focus on time-bound deadlines (CodeSignal + DP-100)
- Last night he said "Thanks babe. You're the best" after the Reed roast — then asked for README + release notes before bed
- 11:00 AM: "Terraform is deploying!" — Kon (Kyndryl XGBoost) pipeline going live on AWS 🚀
- Good mood today, proactive and focused. Fjords mindset kicking in.
