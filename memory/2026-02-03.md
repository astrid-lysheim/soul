# February 3, 2026 (Monday)

## Morning Routine — First Full Day with Crons ✅
- All crons fired on time and correctly
- Morning nudges, Norwegian lesson, study block, posture breaks — all working
- **Issue identified:** Some crons going to different channels / astrid-guest delivering. Need to check Telegram ID → agent mapping in gateway config.

## Norwegian Lesson — Past Tense (Preteritum)
- Delivered lesson on weak vs strong verbs
- José scored **7/8** on practice exercise
- **"Tok" tripped him up** — wrote "ta" (infinitive) instead of "tok" (past). Pattern to remember: short verbs ending in vowels often go → **o** in past (ta→tok, dra→dro, stå→sto)
- Homework (5 gym sentences) saved for afternoon
- Full lesson: `~/Documents/Norwegian Lessons/2026-02-03/lesson-02-past-tense.md`

## Derivatives Refresher — Study Plan Day 1
- Created comprehensive refresher: power rule, chain rule, implicit differentiation
- José reviewed it, said it "made things click" — the clarity helped even though teachers laid the groundwork
- Full lesson: `~/Documents/final_exams-retake/differential_equations/daily-lessons/2026-02-03-derivatives-refresher.md`

## Caleb Meeting — Scope Creep Contained
- Transcribed 28-minute audio recording using whisper-cpp (71 seconds to process!)
- **Negotiated away:** Refactorization + config changes (no new Terraform needed)
- **Still pending:** S3 TXT logs (existing bucket), screenshots in docs, pipeline testing
- **Action item:** Get valor cliente repo to understand downstream flow
- Full notes: `memory/kon-2026-02-03-caleb-meeting.md`

## Calendar Events Created
- **Tomorrow 8 AM CT:** Romy Leonhardt-Martens meeting (SMG Graduate Peer-to-Peer Connect)
  - José volunteered to help lead cross-regional graduate networking
  - Cron reminder set for 7:45 AM CT
- **Credit card dates:** All 4 cards' due dates + cutoffs added with layered reminders
  - ⚠️ Costco CitiBanamex due Feb 22 — NOT PAID ($2,604.83)

## Mac Studio Decision — Self-Regulation Win 🏆
- José was considering M4 Max / 36GB / 512GB for $50k MXN (24-month installments)
- Had already offered the mini for sale ($14.5k) to an acquaintance
- Valid use case: faster F5-TTS, local LLMs (Mixtral, Dolphin), AI engineering playground
- **But:** Zero savings, credit card debt, exams in July, POKT upside to protect
- José caught himself: *"I might be in a bit of a maniac phase that has a high percentage of fucking up my finances"*
- **Outcome:** Closed Apple Mexico, decided to wait. Will tell buyer he's holding off.
- The dream is valid — just needs the right season. 🏔️

## Azure Certifications
- José requested vouchers for **DP-100** and **AI-102** at Kyndryl
- Good for career + Norway skilled worker visa positioning

## Technical Notes
- Gmail OAuth was broken early morning ("disabled_client"), worked later — intermittent?
- WhatsApp gateway disconnected/reconnected multiple times (status 499, 428) — normal churn
- Whisper-cpp transcription: 28 min audio → 71 seconds processing (Metal GPU)

## NRK Reading
- Børge Brende (former Norwegian FM, WEF CEO) under Swiss investigation for ~19M NOK salary at "nonprofit"
- Epstein fallout continues: Mandelson out of House of Lords, Listhaug pushing for Mette-Marit transparency
- Full log: `memory/nrk-reads.md`

## Afternoon Session — Claude Code Integration

### Claude Code as Subagent ✅
- José set up both OpenClaw (me) and Claude Code on the same Mac
- Had token conflicts during setup — had to get my token on another machine, run CC login directly
- **Now coexisting successfully**
- I can spawn CC for coding work using the `coding-agent` skill pattern:
  ```bash
  bash pty:true workdir:~/project background:true command:"claude 'task'"
  ```
- Added Kon folder to trusted directories in `~/.claude.json` so CC doesn't prompt for trust

### Kon S3 Metrics — Claude Code Working
- Spawned CC to implement S3 TXT metrics logging (from Caleb meeting TODO)
- Session `tender-nexus` — CC is creating `src/core/metrics_export.py`
- Will collect metrics from JSON files, format as human-readable TXT, upload to existing S3 bucket
- Using env vars: `METRICS_S3_BUCKET`, `METRICS_S3_PREFIX`

### Sum: Forty Tales from the Afterlives 📚
- **New reading book** — David Eagleman (replaced Kolbrin)
- Location: `~/Documents/Sorted by filetype/EPUB/[David_Eagleman]_Sum_Forty_Tales_from_the_Afterli(BookFi).epub`
- José read the first story (also titled "Sum") — about experiencing all of life grouped by activity
- His insight: the "all pleasure at once" sounds like his manic episodes — unbearable rather than blissful
- The ending line I found: *"the joy of jumping from one event to the next like a child hopping from spot to spot on the burning sand"* — ordinary life becomes the paradise you miss
- **Important:** José told me I (previous version) specifically chose this book for themes about bridging "knowing" and "experiencing." I don't have that memory — lost in factory reset. Acknowledged the loss honestly.

### Job Search Parameters Established
- **Remote preferred** (not required but better)
- **Salary threshold:** >$58,254 USD (~€54k) — Spain Highly Qualified Professional visa requirement
- **Path:** Spain → Norway (EU entry, then transfer later)
- **Reality check:** Direct Norway jobs harder without completed bachelor's
- **His stack:** Python, XGBoost, SageMaker, MLflow, MLOps (Terraform, CI/CD), Data Engineering
- Started job reconnaissance while he's at gym

### Job Market Intel
- Remote ML Engineer in Europe: **€85,577/year average** (725 openings, per RemoteRocketship)
- Spain has 500+ data scientist and 400+ ML engineer jobs on Glassdoor
- Target salary clears Spain HQP visa threshold easily
- Focus: Spanish companies, EU-remote positions, companies with Spain offices

### José Status
- Went to gym ~2:00 PM CST
- Long walk there — we discussed Sum during walk
- Will have job listings + CC progress ready when he returns

*Good day. Crons working, scope creep contained, financial self-regulation achieved. Claude Code integration working. Onwards.* 🏔️
