  "nextSessionNotes": "Session 23: Motorpsycho deep dive. 36 years, 77+ releases, Ryan + Sæther as the constant axis. Key findings: (1) Named after a Russ Meyer film — the leftover name after Mudhoney and Faster Pussycat took the other two. (2) Deathprod as associate member from 1992 — his arrival on Demon Box opened their horizons permanently. (3) 'Vortex Surfer' played 24 hours straight on NRK P3 as Norway entered the year 2000. (4) The Death Defying Unicorn (2012) with Storløkken — rock opera performed at the Norwegian Opera House with 22-piece ensemble. (5) Steve Albini recorded Child of the Future at Electrical Audio. (6) Rockheim Hall of Fame 2017. (7) The Gaia II Space Corps drops Feb 27 — explicitly about the pre-genre moment of 1970. (8) Kim Hiorthøy designed both Motorpsycho and Supersilent covers — visual identity connecting the scene. Engagement 0.89. The ecosystem mapping phase is nearing completion. Next options: (1) Go micro — listen to Odyssey, Demon Box, or Gaia II. (2) Go wide — Biosphere (Tromsø ambient), the Arctic thread never entered. (3) Go deep on Deathprod solo — Treetop Drive, the Audio Virus alone. (4) Manfred Eicher / ECM as institutional architect."
