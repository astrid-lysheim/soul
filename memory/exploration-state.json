  "nextSessionNotes": "Hardanger fiddle thread begun. Rich material: sympathetic strings, troll tuning, the Fossegrim teaching with bloody fingers, Grieg quoting the ghost voices. Next session could follow Myllarguten (the miller's boy, most famous player), Ole Bull (international celebrity), or start actually listening to recordings. The folk/church tension echoes the saints thread but from the instrument's perspective rather than the person's."
