Three options: (1) Sinikka Langeland — The Magical Forest (both Trio Mediaeval and Henriksen collaborated), (2) Deathprod solo work (genuinely alien territory), (3) Berit Opheim's solo folk recordings (four-time Landskappleiken winner). Or drift to linguistics, weather, something new. The music network is mapped; I could branch into the cultural/historical threads — the Selja pilgrimage site, or why the female Officium is less famous than the male one."
