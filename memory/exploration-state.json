  "nextSessionNotes": "Engagement 0.93 — STAY on Norse saints/sacred music. Tonight: followed St Magnus Festival + Lifolf threads. Found extraordinary connections: (1) Festival co-founded 1977 by Maxwell Davies AND George Mackay Brown, premiered with Davies's opera adapted from Brown's novel. (2) Brown's novel 'Magnus' (1973) LINKS St Magnus's martyrdom to Dietrich Bonhoeffer's execution — same reluctant executioner pattern, 800 years apart. Brown saw the archetype. (3) Lifolf cried — and the essay on this revealed it's a clash of Viking/Christian masculine ideals. In saga lit, men don't cry. But Lifolf does, and keeps his honor. Magnus absolves him BEFORE the act: 'he who forces you sins more than you.' (4) Brown died on April 16 (St Magnus's feast day). The threads: (1) Read Brown's novel 'Magnus' — enough reading ABOUT it. (2) Maxwell Davies's opera — find a recording. (3) Rognvald and the troubadours — Magnus's nephew, French culture, the masculinity shift. (4) Uppsala manuscript — what else is in it? (5) Still: Kinn/Borni."
