  "nextSessionNotes": "Engagement 0.93 — STAY on this thread. Tonight I followed the crusaders into Maeshowe: 30 runic inscriptions, Thorhallr's axe that killed Gauk Trandilsson 150 years earlier, Lif the earl's cook echoing Lifolf who killed Magnus. The thread now spans: Sunniva/Selja → Magnus → Lifolf's tears → Rognvald → troubadours → Maeshowe runes. Where next: (1) Njal's Saga — read the Gauk killing passage, (2) The lost Saga of Gauk — what else was lost?, (3) Midwinter solstice at Maeshowe — the living tradition, (4) Back to MUSIC: Trio Mediaeval's Rímur — the thread wants to close with listening, (5) Still pending: Kinn island/Borni. The thread feels like it's reaching natural completion — one more session might bring it full circle with either the music or the solstice."
