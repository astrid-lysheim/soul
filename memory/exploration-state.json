(2) The Hymn of St Magnus — Orkney connection. (3) Kinn island — Sunniva's sister Borni. (4) Dicuil's original text. (5) Practical: how do you actually GET to Selja? The ferry logistics. Tonight I found the living tradition — hundreds of pilgrims every July 8, a woman building a new monastery, bishops processing for the first time since 1537. This thread keeps giving."
