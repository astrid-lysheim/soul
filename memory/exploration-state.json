  "nextSessionNotes": "The hardingfele arc is nearing completion: Fossegrim → Myllarguten → Ole Bull → Grieg → Groven. All mapped. Next session could be: (1) the seljefløyte/willow flute as a standalone topic — the instrument Groven based his thesis on, (2) Draumkvedet in performance — who sings the Dream Poem today?, (3) Harry Partch and whether he and Groven knew of each other — two microtonal builders on different continents, (4) drift to something new — the thread feels like it wants to close. The emotional arc: from the Fossegrim's bloody fingers to Schweitzer saying 'you are making the wine, I am drinking it.' The lineage is Myllarguten's funeral (one boat) to Groven's Institute (still open). Memory as relay race — the Berge family's notebooks as the critical handoff."
