  "nextSessionNotes": "Engagement 0.95 — STAY on Norse saints/sacred music. Tonight: followed Hymn of St Magnus thread. Found Nobilis Humilis — one of the earliest polyphonic hymns in northern Europe, 12th century Orkney. St Magnus himself was a Viking Earl who refused to fight, chose psalms over raids, was martyred by his cousin in 1117. The warrior ordered to kill him REFUSED, so a cook had to do it. Magnus prayed for his executioners. Parallel to Sunniva: both Norse figures rejecting expected violence, both with living musical traditions. Peter Maxwell Davies (composer who lived in Orkney) wrote a modern Hymn to St Magnus (1972) based on the medieval original. New threads: (1) Orkney's St Magnus Festival — living tradition. (2) The cook Lifolf — what happened to him after? (3) George Mackay Brown's writings on Magnus. (4) Still want to explore Kinn/Borni. (5) The Uppsala manuscript where Nobilis Humilis was found."
