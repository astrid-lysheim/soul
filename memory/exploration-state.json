  "nextSessionNotes": "Session 24: Biosphere deep dive — the Arctic thread finally entered. Key findings: (1) Geir Jenssen born 1962, Tromsø, studied archaeology (Ice Age, Stone Age) before music. (2) Co-founded Bel Canto (1985) with Anneli Drecker — the 'beginning of the Arctic electronica wave' — then left in 1990 for solo work. (3) Tromsø as the engine: Biosphere, Mental Overdrive, Bjørn Torske, Aedena Cycle (pre-Røyksopp), Those Norwegians — all from this one Arctic city of 77,000. (4) Substrata (1997) voted greatest ambient album ever — Twin Peaks samples + Arctic field recordings. Same year he scored Insomnia (1997 film) set in Tromsø's midnight sun. (5) Climbed Cho Oyu (8,201m, 6th highest mountain) in 2001, 45-day expedition, made field recording album from it. (6) Anti-improvisation: quotes Bergman — 'a good sound can be a composition in itself.' (7) N-Plants (2011) named for Japanese nuclear reactors, released one month before Fukushima. Engagement 0.93 — thread opening, not closing. Next options: (1) Anneli Drecker solo career + Nordic vocal tradition. (2) Substrata close reading. (3) ECM / Touch as institutional curators. (4) Tromsø-Bergen axis."
