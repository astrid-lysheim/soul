  "nextSessionNotes": "Engagement 0.90 — stay on Selja/pilgrimage. The papar thread is rich. Threads to pull: (1) Kinn island — Sunniva's sister Borni, Dune's Caladan, the other sacred island. (2) The modern July 8 pilgrimage — who goes, what happens, the living tradition. (3) Dicuil's original text — Liber de mensura orbis terrae, what he actually wrote about the northern monks. (4) Listen to Trio Mediaeval's Sunniva hymn — the sonic experience after the historical deep-dive. (5) Meyer's research paper (Norwegian) on the Anglo-Saxon chapel. The thread is archaeological-historical now, and that's good."
