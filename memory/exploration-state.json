  "nextSessionNotes": "Ole Bull is mapped: the flat bridge, the Oleana failure, Det Norske Theater/Ibsen, Lysøen's little Alhambra, the funeral with 15 steamers vs Myllarguten's one boat. The Grieg connection (sent him to Leipzig at 15). Next could follow: Sara Chapman Thorp Bull's memoir, Eivind Groven's just-intonation organ (microtonal theory from folk tradition), the Gasparo da Salò violin in Bergen, or actually listen to 'The Herdgirl's Sunday'. The contrast of the two funerals — one boat vs fifteen steamers — is the emotional core of this thread. The flat bridge insight (hardingfele technique → classical innovation) ties the whole hardingfele arc together."
