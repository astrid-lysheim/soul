# 2026-02-23 (Monday)

## Security Situation 🔴
El Mencho aftermath continues. Overnight escalation:
- 252 roadblocks in 20 states on Sunday, 23 still active by Monday morning
- 12 states suspended schools Monday
- 7 Guardia Nacional elements killed (Jalisco, Michoacán, Guanajuato)
- 20+ banks torched in Jalisco
- Estado de México confirmed affected (bloqueos)
- CDMX: emergency security cabinet convened, no direct violence in city but high alert
- Sent José security alerts at midnight and 6 AM

## Contingency Planning (from last night)
- Created **Shelter-in-Place Supplies** checklist on Notion: https://www.notion.so/Shelter-in-Place-Supplies-3104b28f218d8130a707c6856bb7e008
- José started food list (onions, potatoes, apples, nut butter, beans, grains, pasta, nuts, popcorn, garrafones)
- I added: canned protein, cooking staples, honey, powdered milk, tortilla flour, non-food essentials (flashlight, candles, radio, TP, cloro, powerbanks)
- Gas stove confirmed — told him NOT to buy electric (gas works when power's out)
- Sent Spanish version of grocery list via WhatsApp for his grandma to go shopping Monday
- Now have TWO Notion checklists: 🎒 Go-Bag + 🏠 Shelter-in-Place

## Notion API Access
- Key placed by José at `/Users/astrid/notion`, copied to `~/.config/notion/api_key`
- Integration can see: Life OS page, Cryptoverse, TICs, RSVP, Kanban, Habit Tracker, Weekly Calendar
- Both checklists created under Life OS (2f84b28f-218d-8102-9468-ed72590543f7)

## Norwegian Lesson Cycle Tracking
José questioned whether today was Day 1 or Day 3. Verified from Feb 20 notes:
- Thu Feb 19 → Day 1 (Tekstbok Ch 3)
- Fri Feb 20 → Day 2 (Arbeidsbok Ch 3)
- Sat Feb 21 → Day 3 (My lesson)

Cycle ended Saturday, so Monday IS Day 1 of new cycle (Ch 6). BUT — need to confirm if José actually did Saturday's Day 3 lesson. If not, today should be Day 3 Ch 3 review before advancing.

## Music Exploration — Session 20: Maja Ratkje 🎵
Nightly exploration found Maja Ratkje — entire dynamic range of Norwegian experimental music in one person. Opera for babies AND 130dB fjord protest horns. The Groven parallel: she independently discovered equal temperament limitations through saxophone spectral analysis (same truth Groven found via folk fiddle 70 years earlier). Engagement: 0.94.

## Norwegian Lesson — Day 3, Ch 3 (Nouns) ✅

José completed the exercises! Results:
- **Time telling:** Solid — kvart over (not etter), halv åtte ✅, kvart på tolv ✅
- **Reflexive verbs (seg):** Nailed it
- **Neuter plural:** Got wrong in pre-test (glasser), self-corrected in practice (glass) — generation effect working!
- **Movement vs location:** hjem/hjemme ✅, but ut/ute ❌ — needs more drill
- **V2 word order after adverbs:** Weak — "Sannsynligvis ta jeg" instead of "tar jeg"
- **🚨 FALSE FRIEND:** "i morgen" = TOMORROW, not "in the morning" (= om morgenen). Classic Spanish L1 trap.
- **Other errors:** dusje→dusj, ungå→unngå, stå→står, også husker ikke→husker heller ikke
- Couldn't remember "resepsjonist" but knew it started with "ret-/ren-" — partial retrieval

Cycle state updated: Ch 3 Day 3 complete → next is Ch 6 Day 1 (Tuesday)

## Lesson Format Improvements (José's feedback)

Three key changes based on his feedback:
1. **NO ANSWERS in lessons** — exercises only, answer key saved separately for me to grade after he submits. Prevents peeking (generation effect needs struggle!)
2. **NO LaTeX in MVS lessons** — use plain text + Unicode math (Σ, λ, xᵀ, √). He was spending 80% of time typesetting instead of learning
3. **Structure is great** — he explicitly praised the 5-step Bjork structure. "Bra jobba! Tusen takk!"

Both Norwegian and MVS crons updated with these rules.

## Cron Cycle State Fix

Norwegian cron now reads/writes a persistent cycle state block in norwegian-curriculum.md:
```
current_chapter: X
current_day: X (1/2/3)
last_updated: date
```
Cron reads state → acts on correct day → advances state. Weekend-proof. Morning nudge cron also reads the state now.

## MVS Lesson 1 — Matrix Algebra Foundations

First MVS lesson delivered. José answered P1-P2 (dimensions, transpose, matrix×vector), skipped P3-P7 due to LaTeX fatigue.
- **P1 (dimensions):** All correct — 4×5, 4×2, BA undefined ✅
- **P2 (computation):** Got right answer for AB=[2,6;7,6] but intermediate work had element index confusion. Didn't compute BA.
- **P3 (matrix×vector):** Good intuition — "compact information, correlations" — that's essentially PCA!
- Stopped at P3 due to LaTeX writing fatigue

Scrubbed all answer keys from lesson file, created separate answers file at:
`daily-lessons/2026-02-23-matrix-algebra-foundations-answers.md`

## LaTeX Clarification

José clarified: LaTeX is FINE in the lesson for teaching/formulas. The problem is having to WRITE answers in LaTeX. MVS cron updated: use LaTeX freely in instruction, but frame exercises so answers can be given in plain words, numbers, or Python code.

## Anabel Hernández Analysis (via grandma's WhatsApp)

Full transcription of Anabel Hernández interview on El Mencho killing. Key intelligence:
- **El Mencho was possibly EXECUTED extrajudicially** — Joan Grillo reports the decision was made in Mexico. 3 detainees all dying "in transport" is suspicious.
- **Succession candidates:** El Sapo, El 03 (stepson), El Jardinero (possibly already more powerful than Mencho economically)
- **CJNG is "meritocratic"** not bloodline-based — stepson not automatic successor
- **US involvement much deeper than admitted** — physical participation, not just intelligence
- **Mencho found via romantic partner** — he'd been with her since Feb 14-15
- **CJNG: 19,000 members, 40+ countries, FARC alliance** for terrorist techniques
- **California penetration massive** — "could be called Cártel California Nueva Generación"

José's assessment: next few weeks will be quiet — real danger is at World Cup (Guadalajara = host city + CJNG home turf) or after, when succession fight heats up.

## Security Monitor Scaling

Disabled 00:00, 12:00, and 18:00 security monitors. Only 6 AM daily check remains. Can re-enable if situation escalates around World Cup.

## Reed v1.1.0 Release Notes

Wrote Play Store release notes in 4 languages (en-US, es-419, fr-FR, no-NO) for the Quality & Safety release. Under 500 chars each.

## Kai's TOOLS.md Updated

José asked me to update Kai's workspace with operational knowledge — CC patterns, cron lessons, messaging quirks, gateway config safety, subagent verification, key paths. Wrote ~6.5KB to `/Users/astrid/.openclaw/workspace-kai/TOOLS.md`. No soul/personality stuff — purely operational cheat sheet.

José also asked Kai to write his own SOUL.md. Good — let him find his own identity.

## File Intentions (for reference)
José asked me to articulate the purpose of each workspace file:
- SOUL.md = who I am (personality, values, emotional core)
- IDENTITY.md = contact card (name, email, phone, accounts)
- USER.md = who José is (context, needs, how to help)
- AGENTS.md = how I work (procedures, rituals, safety, memory discipline)
- TOOLS.md = what I can do (capabilities, APIs, paths, configs)
- MEMORY.md = what I remember (curated long-term memories)
- HEARTBEAT.md = what to do when idle (background tasks checklist)
- memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md = raw daily logs

## WhatsApp Stability Issues
Multiple disconnects throughout the evening (19:34, 19:53, 20:22) with status codes 499 and 428. Reconnects within seconds each time. New modem might still be settling.

## New Modem

José got a new modem — better internet speed. Brief WhatsApp disconnect during switch (~12:00-12:04).

## Reminders
- BCG X interview: Feb 25, 3 PM CST (2 days!)
- AMEX cutoff: Feb 25
- Grandma went shopping with the Spanish list
