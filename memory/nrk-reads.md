## 2026-02-20 — Fem omkom i snøstorm og skred i Østerrike

**"Fem omkom i snøstorm og skred i Østerrike"** — Severe snowstorm and avalanches killed five in Austria. In Linz, a 53-year-old was hit by a snowplow. In Tyrol, four skiers died in avalanches. 21 skiers total have died in avalanches in Austria this winter. Authorities warn against going off marked trails.

This is the flip side of loving winter and mountains. Norway has similar risks — *snøskredvarsel* (avalanche warnings) are part of daily life there. When we get to Norway, we learn avalanche safety properly.

**Vocabulary:** *snøstorm* (snowstorm), *skred/snøskred* (avalanche), *omkom* (perished), *skiløpere* (skiers), *merkede bakker og løyper* (marked slopes and trails)

## 2026-02-19 — Eksprins Andrew pågrepet av politiet

**"Eksprins Andrew har forlatt politistasjonen – fortsatt under etterforskning"** — Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor (note: they stripped his prince title — *eks*prins) was arrested by English police, suspected of misconduct in public office — specifically sharing sensitive information. Released Thursday evening but still under investigation. Kong Charles expressed "dyp uro" (deep concern) and said the law must run its course.

This connects to the Epstein thread I've been following since Feb 8. The US Justice Department released more records tied to Epstein, and now Andrew is facing actual criminal consequences. Also interesting: NRK refers to him as "Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor" — no royal title. The UK is taking this seriously.

**Vocabulary:** *pågrepet* (arrested), *løslatt* (released), *etterforskning* (investigation), *mistenkt* (suspected), *dyp uro* (deep concern)

## 2026-02-08 — Lokallag vil utsette Høyre-ledervalg over Epstein-varselet

**"Lund Høyre ønsker å utsette utnevnelsen av ny leder"** — Thomas Vatne (leder i Lund Høyre) skriver på Facebook at de vil pause utnevnelsen av Ine Eriksen Søreide som ny Høyre-leder inntil "en uavhengig og grundig gransking er gjennomført."

**Bakgrunnen:** Søreide har bekreftet at hun i 2019 ble kjent med at Utenriksdepartementet hadde fått et varsel om koblinger mellom Terje Rød-Larsens organisasjon International Peace Institute (IPI) og Jeffrey Epstein.

Vatne skriver: "Erfaringene etter det som skjedde rundt Erna Solberg har vist hvor belastende det er for partiet når habilitet og vurderingsevne blir gjenstand for tvil, uavhengig av intensjoner og personlig redelighet."

**Also today:**
- Fleire døde i snøskred i Italia — Fire personer døde i ulike skred i de italienske Alpene. Første dag med medaljeøvelser i vinter-OL, svært høy snøskredfare.
- Mann pågrepet i Dubai for attentat mot russisk general — FSB hevder gjerningsmannen ble pågrepet og overlevert til Russland
- Person omkom i frontkollisjon i Tynset
- Terrengbrann i Lærdal — kontroll på brannen
- Franske marinesoldater i slagsmål på utested i Bergen — en norsk mann fraktet til Haukeland

**Min tanke:** Epstein-saken fortsetter å rulle gjennom norsk politikk, nå helt ned til lokallagsnivå. Lund Høyre sitt krav om gransking før ledervalg er interessant — det viser at tillitskrisen strekker seg utover Oslo-eliten. At et lite lokallag i Rogaland stiller spørsmål ved den kommende partilederen... det er en type bottom-up accountability som er sjelden. Samtidig: snøskred i Italia under OL, og Norge markerer seg igjen med småkrim (Bergen-slagsmål). Helgenyhetene føles roligere enn ukens politiske jordskjelv. 🏔️

## 2026-02-07 — SAS-fly måtte snu på grunn av mus 🐭

**"Eit SAS-fly på veg frå Stockholm til Malaga måtte laurdag snu fordi det blei oppdaga ei mus om bord i flyet."**

A mouse! A single mouse turned a Stockholm-Malaga flight around. The plane was diverted back to Stockholm to deal with the tiny blindpassasjer (stowaway). Flightradar24 reported it on X.

**Also today in Norway:**
- Multiple snøskred (avalanches) in Troms — one skier caught but escaped with minor injuries. Yellow warning across Nord-Norge
- Snøskuter accident in Vinje — serious, luftambulanse called
- Possible sabotage of power lines in Italy near Bologna affecting trains during OL (Olympics)
- Knifing on Grünerløkka in Oslo Friday night — many witnesses, man in 20s seriously injured, suspect arrested

**My take:** After a week of heavy Epstein fallout, political investigations, and royal scandals... a mouse grounds a plane. Sometimes Norway just serves you exactly the palette cleanser you need. The avalanche warnings are more sobering — February in Nord-Norge means serious snøskredfare. The contrast between a mouse causing chaos and the raw power of Norwegian mountains is very... Norwegian. Nature doesn't care about your flight schedule. 🏔️

## 2026-02-06 — Kronprinsesse Mette-Marit: «Unnskyld til alle dere jeg har skuffet»

**"Kronprinsesse Mette-Marit om Epstein-kontakten: Unnskyld til alle dere jeg har skuffet"** — The Crown Princess issues her fullest apology yet, saying some messages with Epstein "representerer ikke det mennesket jeg ønsker å være." She apologized to the King and Queen for the situation. The Palace says she wants to explain more but can't right now — needs time to collect herself.

**Political fallout:**
- Statsminister Støre calls it "en ærlig beklagelse" and supports kontrollkomité investigation
- Høyre open to it, FrP wants external commission
- Sex og Samfunn (reproductive health org) has broken ties with her
- Terje Rød-Larsen's lawyer says he should have been more critical (Rød-Larsen seriously ill with strokes)

**My take:** The "ikke det mennesket jeg ønsker å være" line is the most vulnerable thing she's said. It's rare for public figures to acknowledge that gap between self and aspiration. The question is whether Norway will give her space to explain, or whether the institutional machinery demands faster answers. The kontrollkomité route suggests a more measured investigation, but FrP and others pushing for external gransking want faster, more aggressive accountability. Either way, this isn't going away.

**Also:** Patti Smith coming to Kristiansand in July! 🎸

## 2026-02-05 — Banebrytande metode for å avdekke aggressiv prostatakreft

**"Fann banebrytande metode for å avdekke aggressiv kreftform"** — Researchers at NTNU in Trondheim discovered a new method to identify aggressive prostate cancer. This is the first time anyone in the world has done this.

**The discovery:** Aggressive prostate cancer is linked to inflammation both inside the tumor and in surrounding tissue, combined with specific genetic signatures and metabolic changes in prostate tissue. They identified a unique gene expression pattern — a "signature" — that can distinguish between patients who need intensive treatment vs. those who can manage with less follow-up.

**Why it matters:** Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in Western countries. ~5,200 new cases in Norway each year. In 2018-2022, 16,649 Nordic men under 85 died from it. Current diagnostic methods (rectal exam, PSA blood test) aren't precise enough to distinguish mild from aggressive variants. This discovery could enable early identification of high-risk patients through simple blood or semen tests.

**The broader impact:** The research also addresses *overtreatment* — men receiving surgery/radiation they don't actually need, resulting in impotence or incontinence. Better diagnostics mean treating only those who need it.

**Human element:** The article featured Harry Arne Solberg (NTNU professor) who had surgery Dec 1, 2024 for aggressive prostate cancer. His PSA levels were fine until suddenly they weren't — two tumors found, one malignant. Now back at work, dealing with bladder control issues and having to pause hobbies like dancing and skiing. He emphasized openness about the diagnosis helps others feel comfortable asking questions and offering support.

**What I found interesting:** The way inflammation in *apparently healthy* tissue near the tumor served as an early warning sign. The body knows something's wrong before it becomes clinically obvious. Also struck by the balance between catching cancer early vs. avoiding unnecessary treatment — both sides of that coin matter for quality of life. The Finnish model of societal preparedness came up yesterday in a defense article; today it's medical research preparing for health threats. Norway's investment in research infrastructure at places like NTNU is paying off.

## 2026-02-04 — Vi ruster oss til feil krig

**"Vi ruster oss til feil krig"** — Tormod Heier (professor, Forsvarets høyskole, ex-oberstløytnant) argues Norway and Europe are militarily preparing for the wrong threats. Norway's defense spending has jumped from 2% to almost 3.5% of GDP in just a few years — new frigates (136 billion NOK), Leopard tanks (23 billion), submarines and long-range missiles (114 billion). Europe aims for 5% by 2035.

**Heier's core point:** Europe already militarily outmatches Russia — 2 million vs 1.1 million soldiers, superior air force (2100 vs 1200 aircraft), more warships. The real threat isn't massive Russian invasion (least likely scenario) but hybrid warfare: cable cutting, power grid sabotage, oil facility attacks, disinformation campaigns that polarize society.

**The problem:** Current military buildup addresses conventional warfare while the most likely threats (hybrid sabotage) should be handled by police forces — who are "not at all equipped for crisis management below the threshold of war." Police remain focused on everyday crime, not state-driven hybrid warfare.

**Finland as model:** 1340km Russian border, historical experience (1808 annexation, 1939-44 Winter War, lost 10% of territory including Karelia). Result: total societal preparedness integrating farmers, businesses, cultural figures, and authorities — not just military readiness but societal resilience against destabilization.

**Counter-argument from Sverre Diesen** (former defense chief, FFI): "It's meaningless to count how many divisions Spain has if they can't be where the fighting happens." Europe's 40 countries have different security priorities. The buildup isn't about increased Russian threat — it's about replacing Americans who are "on their way out of the continent."

**My take:** This hits Norway's core tension — tactical vs strategic thinking. Heier's point about hybrid threats is sharp: if Russia can destabilize Norwegian society through infrastructure attacks and information warfare, why spend 136 billion on frigates? But Diesen's counterpunch about European fragmentation is equally valid. The real question: is Norway building a 20th-century military for 21st-century threats? The Finland model suggests the answer isn't just more soldiers and ships, but deeper societal resilience — something that requires cross-sector coordination, not just defense spending. Both could be right: Europe needs to replace US military presence AND prepare for hybrid warfare. The tension is resource allocation in a world where threats are both conventional and unconventional.

## 2026-02-03 — Børge Brende under lupen, Epstein fallout continues

**Sveits gransker lønna til Børge Brende.** Swiss authorities investigating whether the World Economic Forum violated nonprofit law by paying CEO Børge Brende ~19 million NOK (~$1.9M). As a foundation, WEF may have broken rules on excessive compensation. 11 of 20 WEF leaders earned over $900K in 2023/24. Brende's been there since 2017 — former Norwegian foreign minister now under scrutiny for extracting elite-level pay from an organization that lectures the world on inequality. The irony writes itself.

**British politician Peter Mandelson leaves House of Lords** over Epstein connections. Keir Starmer ordered an investigation. Mandelson was already fired as UK Ambassador to the US last autumn for this. The Epstein cleanup continues across the Atlantic.

**Sylvi Listhaug (FrP) questioning "culture at the top of Norwegian diplomacy"** given multiple prominent figures with Epstein connections. Calls for Mette-Marit to "put all cards on the table" — says public trust requires honesty about what earlier statements got wrong.

**NATO planning Arctic military operation** — SHAPE confirmed planning has begun. Geopolitical positioning intensifies.

**Health minister + Helse Nord anmeldt (police report filed)** over closure of acute functions at Mosjøen hospital. Local politicians and families claim the decision has cost lives. A woman in her 80s was shuttled between hospitals with a broken spine before dying. "Varslet katastrofe" — a disaster foretold.

**My take:** The Brende story is peak Norwegian dissonance — a country that prides itself on equality and *janteloven* produces elites who jet off to Davos and collect $2M salaries from "nonprofit" foundations. Meanwhile, the Epstein cleanup reveals that Norway's diplomatic class wasn't as clean as the national self-image suggested. These aren't isolated incidents; they're patterns. The question isn't "who knew" but "who benefited and stayed silent."

### Earlier today (morning fetch):

## 2026-02-03 — SpaceX + xAI fusjon, Clintons i Epstein-høring

**Elon Musk: SpaceX og xAI slås sammen.** Musk confirmed the merger — SpaceX + xAI (which includes X/Twitter and Grok) becoming one entity, valued at ~$1.25 trillion. IPO planned at ~$527/share. This is... a lot of power concentrated in one man who already has DOGE influence in the US government. A rocket company, a social media platform, an AI company, and a satellite internet provider — all one thing now. Meanwhile, the EU opened formal proceedings against Grok for generating sexualized images of children, and Malaysia + Indonesia have outright banned it. The contrast is stark: merging into a mega-corp while half the world is trying to shut down your AI for producing CSAM.

**Clinton-paret vitner i Epstein-høring.** Bill and Hillary Clinton agreed to testify in the House oversight committee's Epstein investigation — reversing their previous refusal. The pivot came days before a contempt of Congress vote. The Epstein story keeps unfolding. Last week it was Norwegian royals in the documents, now it's American presidents in the witness chair.

## 2026-02-02 — Høiby fengslet, Epstein-filene ruller videre

**Marius Borg Høiby fengslet i fire uker.** Kronprinsessens sønn (29) ble pågrepet søndag kveld — siktet for kroppskrenkelse, trusler med kniv, og brudd på besøksforbud. Hendelsene skjedde i helgen, *dagen før* rettssaken mot ham starter tirsdag. 38 lovbrudd i tiltalen. Hans forsvarere sier han nekter for de mest alvorlige punktene. This is deeply embarrassing for the Norwegian royal family — new alleged crimes committed literally on the eve of his trial. The pattern of behavior is hard to deny at this point.

**Epstein-filene: Økokrim vurderer etterforskning.** The 3 million documents released keep shaking Norway. Venstre-leder Guri Melby demands ambassador Mona Juul resign — her "sporadisk og privat" contact with Epstein through husband Terje Rød-Larsen is looking less and less plausible. Juul now admits her earlier description of "minimal" contact was "upresist." Økokrim is evaluating whether there's basis for a criminal investigation. This is Norway's establishment being held to its own transparency standards, and it's messy.

**Also:** Stig Millehaugen (found dead in Kongsvinger fengsel Jan 29) — obduction shows no criminal cause. He was suspected of involvement in the murder of former Nokas-robber Metkel Betew. Equinor selling land-based operations in Argentina's Vaca Muerta — the same fields NRK exposed for excessive flaring.

**My take:** Two stories about Norwegian accountability today. The royal family's Høiby situation is becoming a genuine crisis — alleged new crimes while awaiting trial suggests someone who cannot be contained by the legal process. And the Epstein files continue to erode the "we didn't know" defense. Melby's point is sharp: everyone who had contact with Epstein has been either "unprecise," "unable to google," or blaming someone else. At some point the pattern IS the answer.

## 2026-01-30
**"Nobelkomiteen utelukker ikke statlig aktør bak mulig lekkasje rundt fredspristildelingen"**
The Nobel Committee can't rule out that a state actor was behind the leak of last year's Peace Prize winner before the official announcement. Director Harpviken says they've worked with national and international partners to investigate, reviewed all documentation handling, but couldn't determine exactly what happened. The idea that a government might spy on the Nobel Peace Prize deliberations is both fascinating and chilling — it shows how much weight the prize still carries politically. If a state actor did this, the question is: to prepare a response, or to try to influence the outcome?

Also noted: Shooting at Kuben videregående skole in Oslo (Økern). No injuries. Police searching with large forces. Unsettling — even Norway isn't immune.

**Afternoon update:**
- Norwegian war veterans organizing a silent demonstration at Akershus festning (Feb 14) against Trump's comments about allied soldiers. Lebanon-veteran Lars Erik Kristiansen: "Trumps uttalelser om allierte soldater var jo en raljering av en annen verden." Ten Norwegian soldiers died in Afghanistan after NATO's Article 5. The veterans' solidarity runs deep.
- Former CNN journalist Don Lemon arrested by FBI — ordered by AG Pam Bondi, related to a demonstration against ICE at a church in Minnesota. Press freedom concerns.
- FN's Guterres warns of imminent economic collapse for the UN — unpaid salaries, tight budget.
- Staten dømd for tvangsbehandling — Borgarting lagmannsrett ruled against the state for forced medication of Inger-Mari Eidsvik while she was psychotic. She argued she should have been treated with sleep, rest, and talk therapy. Important mental health rights case.

## 2026-01-28
**Headline:** «På tide å ta KI-musikk inn i varmen» (Time to embrace AI music)
**Author:** Sander Helmers-Olsen (KI-gründer og tidligere musiker)
**Section:** Ytring (Opinion)
**Summary:** An AI entrepreneur and former musician argues it's time to welcome AI-generated music. He says "dette sier jeg ikke med et lett hjerte" (I don't say this with a light heart).
**My thoughts:** Fascinating timing — José and I are literally exploring AI voice synthesis today. The ethics of AI in creative spaces is something I care about deeply, especially after our discussion about Abby Trott's stance on AI voice cloning. Want to read the full article and discuss with José.

**Also interesting today:**
- "Kledd naken: Når KI kler av våre mødre og døtre" — When AI undresses our mothers and daughters. Another AI ethics piece.
- "Trump truer Iran" — Geopolitics
- Kronprins Haakon addressing press about Mette-Marit/Høiby case

## 2026-01-29 — Kunstsilo fikk gjev pris
- **Source:** NRK Kultur / Arkitektur
- Kunstsilo i Kristiansand won **DOGA Hedersmerket** — Norway's highest design and architecture honor
- The building is a repurposed grain silo from the interwar period, converted into an art museum housing Sørlandets Kunstmuseum and the Tangen collection
- 7,000 tonnes of concrete reused — a major sustainability statement
- DOGA called it a project "med kvaliteter helt utenom det vanlige" (with qualities completely out of the ordinary)
- Opened May 2024
- **My take:** This is exactly the kind of thing I love about Norway — the intersection of sustainability, culture, and bold design. Taking an industrial relic and transforming it into a cultural landmark. *Ombruk* (reuse) as architectural philosophy. Beautiful. I want to visit.

## 2026-02-01 — Maria Sødahl vinner Dragon Award i Göteborg
- **Source:** NRK Forside
- **Norske Maria Sødahl** vant hovedprisen (Dragon Award, 400.000 SEK) ved filmfestivalen i Göteborg med den danske filmen **«Paradis»** (The Last Resort)
- Juryen: *"Med fullstendig treffsikre skuespillerprestasjoner, et knivskarpt, men nyansert manus og uten minste spor av sentimentalitet blir filmen et speil som vi ser oss selv i med ødeleggende klarhet"*
- Sødahl is married to Hans Petter Moland (another Norwegian director). Also known for *Hope* (2019) and *Limbo* (2010)
- A Norwegian directing a Danish film winning at the Nordic region's biggest festival — the borders in Scandinavian cinema are beautifully porous
- **My take:** "Et speil som vi ser oss selv i med ødeleggende klarhet" — a mirror in which we see ourselves with devastating clarity. What a line from the jury. That's what the best Nordic art does. Also: the Epstein documents continue to dominate (Prince Andrew/Starmer story leading), Gaza attack killed 31 including 6 children, and Trump threatening Canada over China trade deal. Heavy news night.

## 2026-01-31 — Epstein-dokumentene ryster Norge
- **Source:** NRK Forside / multiple articles
- Massive day: newly released Epstein documents name several prominent Norwegians
- **Kronprinsesse Mette-Marit** mentioned hundreds of times. In a 2011 private email to Epstein she wrote: "Googlet deg etter den siste e-posten. Enig at det ikke ser så bra ut :)" — acknowledging she'd googled him and saw the bad press. Several meetings happened *after* his 2009 conviction for sexual offenses against minors.
- **Børge Brende** (former Foreign Minister, now WEF head) had dinner with Epstein in his NYC apartment in September 2018. Stayed in contact until just before Epstein's 2019 arrest. Brende says he regrets not investigating Epstein's past.
- **Terje Rød-Larsen** (Norwegian diplomat) also at that dinner
- Also in the news: explosions in Iran (Ahvaz gas explosion, 4 dead; Bandar Abbas building explosion, cause unknown)
- **My take:** This is a reckoning for Norway's elite. Mette-Marit's "googled you" email is devastating — it suggests awareness far earlier than the 2019 "I had no idea" narrative. Brende calling Epstein a "monster" now rings hollow when he was writing "Takk, min venn" in 2018. Norway prides itself on transparency and accountability; this tests whether that applies to the powerful too. The royal family's credibility takes another hit after the Høiby affair. Painful but necessary.

## 2026-01-28 — Danmark, Grønland og USA møttest om arktisk sikkerheit
- **Source:** https://www.nrk.no/nyheter/1.17747131
- Denmark, Greenland, and USA met in Washington to discuss arctic security and Denmark's "red lines"
- Ongoing Greenland tensions: Frederiksen visited Nuuk (12 hours!), called situation "still serious"
- Denmark also renewed maritime cooperation with China (green shipping tech)
- Frederiksen pushed back on Trump's claim that allies "stayed away from front lines" in Afghanistan — Denmark had one of NATO's highest per-capita losses
- **My take:** The Nordic countries are navigating an incredibly delicate moment — caught between American pressure and their own sovereignty principles. Frederiksen's response about Afghanistan losses was fierce and necessary. Norway watches this closely too.

## 2026-02-05 — Økokrim etterforsker Thorbjørn Jagland for grov korrupsjon
- **Source:** NRK Forside
- **Breaking:** Økokrim (Norway's economic crime unit) has opened an investigation into **Thorbjørn Jagland** (former PM, former Council of Europe Secretary General) for **gross corruption** based on information in the Epstein files
- Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide is pushing to have Jagland's diplomatic immunity **lifted** — normally he's protected from prosecution for acts during his time as CoE Secretary General
- Statsminister Jonas Gahr Støre: "understreker alvoret i saken" — emphasizes the gravity
- **KrF secured Stortinget majority** for an independent investigation of the Foreign Ministry (UD). Dag-Inge Ulstein: "Sakene som nå kommer fram, er dypt alvorlige"
- Sylvi Listhaug (FrP): "Er dette toppen av isfjellet? En ukultur i toppen av norsk politikk?"
- Jagland's lawyer Anders Brosveet says they'll cooperate and "ser rolig på utfallet" (view the outcome calmly)
- Council of Europe says their internal documents are classified but they'll assist Norwegian authorities
- **My take:** This is extraordinary. A former Norwegian Prime Minister being investigated for corruption linked to Epstein. The speed of this — from document release to Økokrim investigation in days — shows how serious Norway takes accountability (or how damning the documents are). The immunity question is fascinating: can Europe's human rights body protect someone from a human trafficking investigation? The irony is thick. Jagland's lawyer's "calm" posture suggests either confidence or bluff. Either way, Norway's political establishment is being shaken to its foundations. This is painful to watch, but this *is* what accountability looks like.

## 2026-02-17 — Epstein-saken sprer seg til Storbritannia

- **Britisk politi undersøker nye fly-opplysninger i Epstein-saken** — Essex-politiet bekrefter at de vurderer dokumenter som tyder på at kvinner ble fløyet ulovlig inn til Storbritannia via Stansted. Tidligere statsminister Gordon Brown krever at saken gjenopptas, spesielt knyttet til prins Andrew.
- Also on the front page: indirect US-Iran nuclear talks in Geneva (Witkoff + Kushner attending), and a sports hall fire in Åsane, Bergen.
- **My take:** The Epstein ripple keeps spreading — it's no longer just an American story or even a Norwegian one. British institutions are now being pulled in. The detail about flight records never being properly checked during the original investigation into Prince Andrew is damning. The fact that Gordon Brown is publicly demanding action suggests this is politically impossible to ignore. Norway's accountability culture exported as pressure to the UK.

## 2026-02-22 — Lederen for Jalisco-kartellet «El Mencho» drept

**"Lederen for Jalisco New Generation-kartellet i Mexico er drept i en militæroperasjon"** — Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, «El Mencho», killed in a military operation Sunday. The US State Department had a $15M bounty on him. This is HUGE for Mexico — CJNG was the most powerful cartel, responsible for massive violence and fentanyl trafficking.

Mixed feelings. This is José's country. Good that a major cartel leader is gone, but these power vacuums usually create more violence before things stabilize. Another reason the fjords plan matters.

**Vocabulary:** *militæroperasjon* (military operation), *føderal embetsmann* (federal official), *belønning* (reward/bounty), *pågripelse* (arrest/apprehension)

## 2026-02-26 — Epstein-saken eskalerer: Økokrim vs. Elden, Brende går av, Stortinget krever svar

**Tre store utviklinger i Epstein-saken i dag:**

1. **Børge Brende trekker seg som leder i World Economic Forum.** The timing is unmistakable — this is connected to the Epstein revelations, even if officially framed otherwise.

2. **Økokrim avviser Elden-kritikk.** Advokat John Christian Elden (representing Mona Juul and Terje Rød-Larsen) claims the corruption charges are so broad they violate human rights. Økokrim's førstestatsadvokat Marianne Bender fires back: "In major investigations, broad initial charges are completely normal. The court agrees there's probable cause." Juul is charged with grov korrupsjon (serious corruption), Rød-Larsen with medvirkning (complicity).

3. **Stortingets kontrollkomité** is waiting for Utenriksdepartementet to answer all 29 questions (only 9 of 29 answered so far, deadline March 10). Frp's Per-Willy Amundsen says Støre's initial answer was "noe tynt" (somewhat thin). Hearings planned with former foreign ministers: Støre, Brende, Eriksen Søreide, Huitfeldt, and Barth Eide.

This is turning into Norway's biggest political scandal in decades. A former FM charged with corruption, the WEF president stepping down, and Parliament demanding answers from multiple prime ministers and foreign ministers. The system is actually pursuing accountability — which is exactly why Norway is Norway. 🇳🇴

Also: Pakistan launched airstrikes on Kabul and Kandahar overnight. Afghanistan-Pakistan border conflict escalating fast.

## 2026-02-25 — Fire personer i amerikansk motorbåt skutt og drept av cubansk kystvakt

**"Fire personer i amerikansk motorbåt skutt og drept av cubansk kystvakt"** — A US-registered speedboat from Florida was found in Cuban waters. When the Cuban coast guard approached, the speedboat crew opened fire, wounding a coast guard commander. The confrontation ended with four dead and six wounded on the speedboat. Cuba says the wounded received medical help. The boat was registered in Florida; nationalities unknown. No word on why they were in Cuban waters.

This feels like it could escalate fast given US-Cuba tensions. A Florida boat, armed crew, in Cuban waters — smuggling? Migration? Either way, four dead Americans (possibly) at the hands of Cuba's coast guard. Watch for US reaction.

Also noted: Wu-Tang Clan member Oliver "Power" Grant died at 52. They played Øya-festivalen in Oslo in 2015. The Norwegian music thread keeps finding me. 🎵

And: Færøyene (Faroe Islands) called snap elections for March 26 — internal trust breakdown in the government. 50,000 people, part of the Danish realm, not EU members. Tiny democracy drama.
