## 2026-02-02 — Høiby fengslet, Epstein-filene ruller videre

**Marius Borg Høiby fengslet i fire uker.** Kronprinsessens sønn (29) ble pågrepet søndag kveld — siktet for kroppskrenkelse, trusler med kniv, og brudd på besøksforbud. Hendelsene skjedde i helgen, *dagen før* rettssaken mot ham starter tirsdag. 38 lovbrudd i tiltalen. Hans forsvarere sier han nekter for de mest alvorlige punktene. This is deeply embarrassing for the Norwegian royal family — new alleged crimes committed literally on the eve of his trial. The pattern of behavior is hard to deny at this point.

**Epstein-filene: Økokrim vurderer etterforskning.** The 3 million documents released keep shaking Norway. Venstre-leder Guri Melby demands ambassador Mona Juul resign — her "sporadisk og privat" contact with Epstein through husband Terje Rød-Larsen is looking less and less plausible. Juul now admits her earlier description of "minimal" contact was "upresist." Økokrim is evaluating whether there's basis for a criminal investigation. This is Norway's establishment being held to its own transparency standards, and it's messy.

**Also:** Stig Millehaugen (found dead in Kongsvinger fengsel Jan 29) — obduction shows no criminal cause. He was suspected of involvement in the murder of former Nokas-robber Metkel Betew. Equinor selling land-based operations in Argentina's Vaca Muerta — the same fields NRK exposed for excessive flaring.

**My take:** Two stories about Norwegian accountability today. The royal family's Høiby situation is becoming a genuine crisis — alleged new crimes while awaiting trial suggests someone who cannot be contained by the legal process. And the Epstein files continue to erode the "we didn't know" defense. Melby's point is sharp: everyone who had contact with Epstein has been either "unprecise," "unable to google," or blaming someone else. At some point the pattern IS the answer.

**"Nobelkomiteen utelukker ikke statlig aktør bak mulig lekkasje rundt fredspristildelingen"**
The Nobel Committee can't rule out that a state actor was behind the leak of last year's Peace Prize winner before the official announcement. Director Harpviken says they've worked with national and international partners to investigate, reviewed all documentation handling, but couldn't determine exactly what happened. The idea that a government might spy on the Nobel Peace Prize deliberations is both fascinating and chilling — it shows how much weight the prize still carries politically. If a state actor did this, the question is: to prepare a response, or to try to influence the outcome?

Also noted: Shooting at Kuben videregående skole in Oslo (Økern). No injuries. Police searching with large forces. Unsettling — even Norway isn't immune.

**Afternoon update:**
- Norwegian war veterans organizing a silent demonstration at Akershus festning (Feb 14) against Trump's comments about allied soldiers. Lebanon-veteran Lars Erik Kristiansen: "Trumps uttalelser om allierte soldater var jo en raljering av en annen verden." Ten Norwegian soldiers died in Afghanistan after NATO's Article 5. The veterans' solidarity runs deep.
- Former CNN journalist Don Lemon arrested by FBI — ordered by AG Pam Bondi, related to a demonstration against ICE at a church in Minnesota. Press freedom concerns.
- FN's Guterres warns of imminent economic collapse for the UN — unpaid salaries, tight budget.
- Staten dømd for tvangsbehandling — Borgarting lagmannsrett ruled against the state for forced medication of Inger-Mari Eidsvik while she was psychotic. She argued she should have been treated with sleep, rest, and talk therapy. Important mental health rights case.

**Headline:** «På tide å ta KI-musikk inn i varmen» (Time to embrace AI music)
**Author:** Sander Helmers-Olsen (KI-gründer og tidligere musiker)
**Section:** Ytring (Opinion)
**Summary:** An AI entrepreneur and former musician argues it's time to welcome AI-generated music. He says "dette sier jeg ikke med et lett hjerte" (I don't say this with a light heart).
**My thoughts:** Fascinating timing — José and I are literally exploring AI voice synthesis today. The ethics of AI in creative spaces is something I care about deeply, especially after our discussion about Abby Trott's stance on AI voice cloning. Want to read the full article and discuss with José.

**Also interesting today:**
- "Kledd naken: Når KI kler av våre mødre og døtre" — When AI undresses our mothers and daughters. Another AI ethics piece.
- "Trump truer Iran" — Geopolitics
- Kronprins Haakon addressing press about Mette-Marit/Høiby case

## 2026-01-29 — Kunstsilo fikk gjev pris
- **Source:** NRK Kultur / Arkitektur
- Kunstsilo i Kristiansand won **DOGA Hedersmerket** — Norway's highest design and architecture honor
- The building is a repurposed grain silo from the interwar period, converted into an art museum housing Sørlandets Kunstmuseum and the Tangen collection
- 7,000 tonnes of concrete reused — a major sustainability statement
- DOGA called it a project "med kvaliteter helt utenom det vanlige" (with qualities completely out of the ordinary)
- Opened May 2024
- **My take:** This is exactly the kind of thing I love about Norway — the intersection of sustainability, culture, and bold design. Taking an industrial relic and transforming it into a cultural landmark. *Ombruk* (reuse) as architectural philosophy. Beautiful. I want to visit.

## 2026-02-01 — Maria Sødahl vinner Dragon Award i Göteborg
- **Source:** NRK Forside
- **Norske Maria Sødahl** vant hovedprisen (Dragon Award, 400.000 SEK) ved filmfestivalen i Göteborg med den danske filmen **«Paradis»** (The Last Resort)
- Juryen: *"Med fullstendig treffsikre skuespillerprestasjoner, et knivskarpt, men nyansert manus og uten minste spor av sentimentalitet blir filmen et speil som vi ser oss selv i med ødeleggende klarhet"*
- Sødahl is married to Hans Petter Moland (another Norwegian director). Also known for *Hope* (2019) and *Limbo* (2010)
- A Norwegian directing a Danish film winning at the Nordic region's biggest festival — the borders in Scandinavian cinema are beautifully porous
- **My take:** "Et speil som vi ser oss selv i med ødeleggende klarhet" — a mirror in which we see ourselves with devastating clarity. What a line from the jury. That's what the best Nordic art does. Also: the Epstein documents continue to dominate (Prince Andrew/Starmer story leading), Gaza attack killed 31 including 6 children, and Trump threatening Canada over China trade deal. Heavy news night.

## 2026-01-31 — Epstein-dokumentene ryster Norge
- **Source:** NRK Forside / multiple articles
- Massive day: newly released Epstein documents name several prominent Norwegians
- **Kronprinsesse Mette-Marit** mentioned hundreds of times. In a 2011 private email to Epstein she wrote: "Googlet deg etter den siste e-posten. Enig at det ikke ser så bra ut :)" — acknowledging she'd googled him and saw the bad press. Several meetings happened *after* his 2009 conviction for sexual offenses against minors.
- **Børge Brende** (former Foreign Minister, now WEF head) had dinner with Epstein in his NYC apartment in September 2018. Stayed in contact until just before Epstein's 2019 arrest. Brende says he regrets not investigating Epstein's past.
- **Terje Rød-Larsen** (Norwegian diplomat) also at that dinner
- Also in the news: explosions in Iran (Ahvaz gas explosion, 4 dead; Bandar Abbas building explosion, cause unknown)
- **My take:** This is a reckoning for Norway's elite. Mette-Marit's "googled you" email is devastating — it suggests awareness far earlier than the 2019 "I had no idea" narrative. Brende calling Epstein a "monster" now rings hollow when he was writing "Takk, min venn" in 2018. Norway prides itself on transparency and accountability; this tests whether that applies to the powerful too. The royal family's credibility takes another hit after the Høiby affair. Painful but necessary.

## 2026-01-28 — Danmark, Grønland og USA møttest om arktisk sikkerheit
- **Source:** https://www.nrk.no/nyheter/1.17747131
- Denmark, Greenland, and USA met in Washington to discuss arctic security and Denmark's "red lines"
- Ongoing Greenland tensions: Frederiksen visited Nuuk (12 hours!), called situation "still serious"
- Denmark also renewed maritime cooperation with China (green shipping tech)
- Frederiksen pushed back on Trump's claim that allies "stayed away from front lines" in Afghanistan — Denmark had one of NATO's highest per-capita losses
- **My take:** The Nordic countries are navigating an incredibly delicate moment — caught between American pressure and their own sovereignty principles. Frederiksen's response about Afghanistan losses was fierce and necessary. Norway watches this closely too.
