# SMG Graduate Connect Meeting Summary
**Date:** February 4, 2026, 8:00 AM CST  
**Participants:** Romy (organizer), José, + another graduate (seems EY/Switzerland background)  
**Context:** Strategic Markets Graduate Program - improving peer connections across borders

---

## Meeting Purpose
Romy wants to improve how SMG graduates connect internationally. Current sessions (vital sessions, strategic market leader presentations) are "monotone" - graduates don't really know each other beyond seeing names/faces in big meetings.

**Romy's goal:** Create better peer-to-peer exchange so graduates understand what others are working on, their experiences, and build real connections.

## José's Contributions 🌟

### Infrastructure Already Exists
- Workday profile modernization allows global visibility
- Mentorship programs available (José has connected with people from **Norway** and **Costa Rica**)
- **Problem:** People don't know how to use tools beyond basics

### Connecting Beyond Work
- LinkedIn outreach to people from sessions (building network)
- Suggests going **beyond work topics** - "in pubs or restaurants one gets to really connect in a human way"
- **Team activities** like Kahoot - "something trivial but gets team spirit going"
- Need to "go through somewhat hard things together" to build collaboration

## EY Peer Pairing Model (Other Participant)

Shared experience from EY Switzerland:
1. **Monthly/bi-weekly 1-on-1 calls** with randomly paired colleagues
2. **Not about business** - just getting to know the person
3. **Rotating responsibility** - Column A sets up call this month, Column B next month
4. Built connections that made it **easier to reach out later** for work questions
5. Suggested doing similar at Kyndryl: 1-on-1 pairs OR small groups of 4

## Mexico Highlight 🇲🇽
Romy specifically mentioned that **Mexico stands out** in the calls she's following - there's "really something happening there" and she wants to know more. This is positive visibility for the Mexico team!

## Next Steps (Implied)
- Set up peer-to-peer 1-on-1 or small group sessions
- Possibly create a pairing system like EY model
- Make connections more personal, not just work-focused

## Astrid's Notes
This meeting is great for José's visibility within Kyndryl's Strategic Markets program. He contributed thoughtful ideas about infrastructure, human connection, and team-building. The mention of Mexico standing out is a positive signal - José is part of what's "happening there."
