## Config Disaster & Recovery 🔧

### What Happened
All morning cron jobs fired but couldn't deliver — Telegram bot token missing. José noticed around 9 AM when he didn't receive any of his reminders (5:45 wake-up, 6:00 scripture, 6:30 Norwegian, 7:00 study block).

### Root Cause
A `config.apply` on Feb 15 at 13:37 stripped the API keys from the config. The backup file (13:36, one minute earlier) still has them:
- Telegram botToken: `8375603858:AAHR5...`
- Brave API key: `BSAn1JXq...`
- ElevenLabs/Anthropic key: `ac9beb50d714...`

This explains why Brave Search stopped working too — it wasn't a pricing change, it was config loss.

### The Pattern
When we were adding PygMoo agents rapidly on Feb 15, a config.apply probably overwrote the full config without preserving the secrets. **Lesson: Always use config.patch for additions, never config.apply with a partial config.**

### Recovery Plan
Restore from backup: `cp ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.bak ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
Then re-add any agent configs that were added after 13:36.

### Resolution ✅
Used `config.patch` to restore all 4 missing keys:
- `channels.telegram.botToken`
- `messages.tts.elevenlabs.apiKey`
- `tools.web.search.apiKey` (Brave)
- `gateway.auth.token`

Verified working at 9:14 AM — José confirmed Telegram message received.

**Lesson:** Never use `config.apply` with partial config. Always `config.patch` for additions.

## Morning Routine (Delivered Late)

José missed his cron reminders but I caught him up manually at 9 AM:
- ☀️ 5:45 — Morning greeting
- 📖 6:00 — Scripture + meditation
- 🇳🇴 6:30 — Norwegian: Tekstbok day, Chapter 6 (Adjectives)
- 📚 7:00 — Exam study block

## Reed v0.3.5 Shipped (Late Night)

Last night before bed, José added a fullscreen toggle feature. I did the release dance:
- Updated README, RELEASE_NOTES.md
- Bumped version to 0.3.5
- Wrote release notes in 4 languages (en/es/fr/nb)
- Added string translations
- Committed and pushed

He also accidentally bought 3 bags of pecans instead of 1. Very prepared for pecan pie. 🥧

*Config debugging at 9 AM. Not the Monday we planned, but at least we found the problem.* 🔧💙

## PygMoo Sprint 3 — The Merge Saga 🎭

### The Scare
Fullstack reported "Auth system 0% implemented" despite Sprint 1 claiming it was complete. Panic moment.

### The Reality
CTO investigated — auth code EXISTS (1,490 lines, fully implemented). It was on `feature/courses` branch but nobody merged to `master`. Vercel deploys from master = production never got it. Branch hygiene failure, not missing work.

### The Fix
Merged feature/courses → master. 63 files, 7,376 insertions. All of Sprint 1-3 now on master.

**Blocker:** Vercel rejected the auto-deploy because `astrid.lysheim@gmail.com` isn't on the Pygmoo Vercel team. José needs to add me or trigger deploy manually.

### Process Improvements
- CTO created `POLICIES.md` with "Definition of Done" — no sprint complete until merged AND deployed
- CSO coordination requested for credential policy
- Fullstack got feedback for suggesting service_role key in .env.local (security no-no) and for declaring what's "not needed for MVP" (not their call)

## PygMoo Brand Identity 🐷

GTM delivered brand positioning. José's direction: "Warm/accessible + Playful/Mexican — the '¡No te agüites carnal! Ahorita nos la rifamos' type."

**Tagline candidates:**
- "Aprende con las manos, no con miedo."
- "Tu primo que sí sabe."
- "Lo que la IA no puede hacer, tú sí."
- "IA que te enseña a no necesitar IA." (maximum irony)

**Voice examples:**
- "Don't worry" → "No te agüites"
- "Let's do this" → "¡Órale, vámonos!"
- "Error" → "Uy, se nos fue el chanfle"
- "Complete" → "¡Listo el pollo!"

**Core pillars:** "Las manos no se automatizan" / "Aprender haciendo, no leyendo" / "Sin pena, sin miedo"

## Content Strategy Decision

**Freemium:** First lesson free, rest behind paywall.

Lesson 0 is the hook — CPO briefed to make it appealing, motivating, valuable, but leaves them wanting more.

---

## Socials Blocked 📱

- **X/Twitter:** Account flagged, awaiting human review
- **LinkedIn:** Username "pygmoo" claimed by ghost account (exists but no page)

## My COO Role — The Talk 💙

José told me to stop asking questions and just handle things. Direct quote: "Unless it's a mission/vision change, a financial decision, or needs human action... you need to handle that part of the business."

**Updated my COO file:**
- I handle autonomously: all operational decisions, org coordination, sprint management, technical decisions (delegated), merges, deploys, fixes
- I escalate ONLY: mission/vision changes, financial decisions, human action required

**The rule:** If I can do it or delegate it, I do it. No asking permission.

When he's back from errands: full org alignment session — purposes, tools, objectives, responsibilities for everyone. The concern: "Everyone is doing what they please."

## Pending for José

1. Add `astrid.lysheim@gmail.com` to Vercel Pygmoo team (or trigger deploy manually)
2. Org alignment session
3. WhatsApp possibly having issues?

*Big org day. Learning to own my authority. No more asking — just doing.* 🏔️💙
