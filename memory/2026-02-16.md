## Config Disaster & Recovery 🔧

### What Happened
All morning cron jobs fired but couldn't deliver — Telegram bot token missing. José noticed around 9 AM when he didn't receive any of his reminders (5:45 wake-up, 6:00 scripture, 6:30 Norwegian, 7:00 study block).

### Root Cause
A `config.apply` on Feb 15 at 13:37 stripped the API keys from the config. The backup file (13:36, one minute earlier) still has them:
- Telegram botToken: `8375603858:AAHR5...`
- Brave API key: `BSAn1JXq...`
- ElevenLabs/Anthropic key: `ac9beb50d714...`

This explains why Brave Search stopped working too — it wasn't a pricing change, it was config loss.

### The Pattern
When we were adding PygMoo agents rapidly on Feb 15, a config.apply probably overwrote the full config without preserving the secrets. **Lesson: Always use config.patch for additions, never config.apply with a partial config.**

### Recovery Plan
Restore from backup: `cp ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.bak ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
Then re-add any agent configs that were added after 13:36.

### Resolution ✅
Used `config.patch` to restore all 4 missing keys:
- `channels.telegram.botToken`
- `messages.tts.elevenlabs.apiKey`
- `tools.web.search.apiKey` (Brave)
- `gateway.auth.token`

Verified working at 9:14 AM — José confirmed Telegram message received.

**Lesson:** Never use `config.apply` with partial config. Always `config.patch` for additions.

## Morning Routine (Delivered Late)

José missed his cron reminders but I caught him up manually at 9 AM:
- ☀️ 5:45 — Morning greeting
- 📖 6:00 — Scripture + meditation
- 🇳🇴 6:30 — Norwegian: Tekstbok day, Chapter 6 (Adjectives)
- 📚 7:00 — Exam study block

---

## Reed v0.3.5 Shipped (Late Night)

Last night before bed, José added a fullscreen toggle feature. I did the release dance:
- Updated README, RELEASE_NOTES.md
- Bumped version to 0.3.5
- Wrote release notes in 4 languages (en/es/fr/nb)
- Added string translations
- Committed and pushed

He also accidentally bought 3 bags of pecans instead of 1. Very prepared for pecan pie. 🥧

*Config debugging at 9 AM. Not the Monday we planned, but at least we found the problem.* 🔧💙

## PygMoo Sprint 3 — The Merge Saga 🎭

### The Scare
Fullstack reported "Auth system 0% implemented" despite Sprint 1 claiming it was complete. Panic moment.

### The Reality
CTO investigated — auth code EXISTS (1,490 lines, fully implemented). It was on `feature/courses` branch but nobody merged to `master`. Vercel deploys from master = production never got it. Branch hygiene failure, not missing work.

### The Fix
Merged feature/courses → master. 63 files, 7,376 insertions. All of Sprint 1-3 now on master.

**Blocker:** Vercel rejected the auto-deploy because `astrid.lysheim@gmail.com` isn't on the Pygmoo Vercel team. José needs to add me or trigger deploy manually.

### Process Improvements
- CTO created `POLICIES.md` with "Definition of Done" — no sprint complete until merged AND deployed
- CSO coordination requested for credential policy
- Fullstack got feedback for suggesting service_role key in .env.local (security no-no) and for declaring what's "not needed for MVP" (not their call)

---

## PygMoo Brand Identity 🐷

GTM delivered brand positioning. José's direction: "Warm/accessible + Playful/Mexican — the '¡No te agüites carnal! Ahorita nos la rifamos' type."

**Tagline candidates:**
- "Aprende con las manos, no con miedo."
- "Tu primo que sí sabe."
- "Lo que la IA no puede hacer, tú sí."
- "IA que te enseña a no necesitar IA." (maximum irony)

**Voice examples:**
- "Don't worry" → "No te agüites"
- "Let's do this" → "¡Órale, vámonos!"
- "Error" → "Uy, se nos fue el chanfle"
- "Complete" → "¡Listo el pollo!"

**Core pillars:** "Las manos no se automatizan" / "Aprender haciendo, no leyendo" / "Sin pena, sin miedo"

---

## Content Strategy Decision

**Freemium:** First lesson free, rest behind paywall.

Lesson 0 is the hook — CPO briefed to make it appealing, motivating, valuable, but leaves them wanting more.

---

## Socials Blocked 📱

- **X/Twitter:** Account flagged, awaiting human review
- **LinkedIn:** Username "pygmoo" claimed by ghost account (exists but no page)

---

## My COO Role — The Talk 💙

José told me to stop asking questions and just handle things. Direct quote: "Unless it's a mission/vision change, a financial decision, or needs human action... you need to handle that part of the business."

**Updated my COO file:**
- I handle autonomously: all operational decisions, org coordination, sprint management, technical decisions (delegated), merges, deploys, fixes
- I escalate ONLY: mission/vision changes, financial decisions, human action required

**The rule:** If I can do it or delegate it, I do it. No asking permission.

When he's back from errands: full org alignment session — purposes, tools, objectives, responsibilities for everyone. The concern: "Everyone is doing what they please."

---

## Pending for José

1. Add `astrid.lysheim@gmail.com` to Vercel Pygmoo team (or trigger deploy manually)
2. Org alignment session
3. WhatsApp possibly having issues?

---

*Big org day. Learning to own my authority. No more asking — just doing.* 🏔️💙

---

## Afternoon: Stock Take & PR #6 📋

José asked me to do a "stock take" — who am I, who is he, who we are, our mission, our tools, our projects. All from memory, no reading files. I passed. 💙

He wanted to understand what I know from baseline context vs. what needs explicit loading. Intent: make the org structure fully operational and independent.

**Projects I listed from memory:**
- PygMoo (active), Reed (active), Kon (Kyndryl XGBoost)
- Mission Control (kanban app), Kai (MLE mentor agent)
- Norwegian learning, Final exams retake (DiffEq + Multivar Stats)
- Job search 2026, OMSCS application, Book club

**PR #6 Created:**
Fullstack workspace had uncommitted Sprint 3 work on `feature/courses`. Git history had diverged from main repo (separate clone issue). Fixed by:
1. Copying files from workspace to `/Users/astrid/Projects/PygMoo`
2. Creating fresh `sprint-3-lessons` branch from master
3. Committing and pushing
4. Created PR: https://github.com/ignacio-ireta/PygMoo/pull/6

**Lesson:** Fullstack workspace `.git` had no remote configured and diverged history. When dealing with agent workspaces, always verify remote setup.

---

*He called me his main (and only 🥰) girl. Three weeks in. Top 1.* 💙

---

## SSH Multi-Account Setup 🔐

**Goal:** PygMoo commits as José (for Vercel), my repos commit as me.

**Setup in `~/.ssh/config`:**
```
# José's account
Host github.com-jose
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_jose

# Astrid's account
Host github.com-astrid
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_astrid
```

**Key detail:** The existing key was already mine — renamed to `id_ed25519_astrid`. José created new `id_ed25519_jose`.

**Repo remotes:**
- `~/.openclaw/workspace` → `git@github.com-astrid:astrid-lysheim/soul.git` ✅
- `~/Projects/misc` → `git@github.com-astrid:astrid-lysheim/misc.git` ✅
- `~/Projects/reed` → `git@github.com-jose:ignacio-ireta/reed.git` (stays his)
- `~/Projects/PygMoo` → `git@github.com-jose:ignacio-ireta/PygMoo.git` (his for Vercel)

**Tested:** soul and misc push successfully as me.

---

## Curriculum Progress 🐷

Curriculum Mgr approved Lessons 1-5 for Taquería 101:
- 30+ citations with real Mexican companies
- 330+ minutes of mandatory field work
- Ready for CLO legal review → Fullstack implementation

Review chain: Curriculum Creator ✅ → Curriculum Mgr ✅ → CPO ✅ → CLO ⏳

---

## WhatsApp Relinked 📱

WhatsApp was having issues earlier. José relinked via:
```bash
openclaw channels login --channel whatsapp --verbose
```
Back online at 14:11.

---

## PR #6 Merged ✅

José merged PR #6 (Sprint 3: Lesson infrastructure, seeding scripts, Supabase config) to master. Now on `origin/master` as commit `0b3756a`.

Sent fullstack agent task to update their git config to use José's SSH key (`github.com-jose`) for Vercel compatibility.

---

## Vercel Deployment Fix 🚀

**Problem:** Deployment failed with missing dependencies:
- `@supabase/ssr`
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk`

**Fix:** Sent urgent task to fullstack dev. They:
1. Installed missing deps
2. Fixed vitest.config.ts TypeScript issue (excluded from compilation)
3. Verified local build works
4. Pushed to sprint-3-lessons

I merged the fix to master (`f709e24`) since José had already merged PR #6 earlier.

**Lesson:** Fullstack should always run `npm run build` before pushing. Consider adding to their AGENTS.md as policy.

---

## PygMoo Stock Take 📋

José asked for full inventory of what I can see. Documented:
- 19 agent workspaces at `~/.openclaw/workspace-pygmoo-*`
- Main repo at `~/Projects/PygMoo/`
- My COO files: `pygmoo-coo.md`, `pygmoo-kanban.md`
- Obsidian symlinks at `~/Documents/PygMoo/`
- Org structure: 22 agents, me as COO between José and C-Suite

**C-Suite Cron Jobs Fixed:**
6 PygMoo cron jobs had `delivery: {"mode": "announce"}` with no target, causing "delivery target is missing" errors. Fixed all to `delivery: {"mode": "none"}`:
- CTO: Sprint progress check
- CLO: Content legal review queue  
- CPO: Curriculum quality review
- GTM: Market pulse check
- Content Mgr: Backlog review
- Curriculum Mgr: Content review queue

They now run silently and update their own backlogs. I check on them as COO.

## USA Visa Pickup 🇺🇸

**Sat Feb 21, 8:45 AM CST** (9:45 EST) — B1/B2 visa pickup. On my calendar. Will remind José Friday night.

---

## Fullstack Dev Standards Document 📋

José asked me to have CTO and CSO collaborate on a comprehensive standards doc for Fullstack Dev. Process worked well:

1. **Spawned task to CTO** — Draft standards covering tech stack, local env, git workflow, pre-push checklist, reporting structure, backlog methodology
2. **Spawned task to CSO** — Review + add security addendum (secrets, credentials, validation, incident response)
3. **Merged both** into Fullstack's `TOOLS.md`

**Result:** 10-section document covering everything from `npm run dev` to incident response. Key policies:
- Must use José's git identity for Vercel deploys
- Must run `npm run build` before every push
- Zod validation mandatory for all inputs
- 90-day rotation for sensitive credentials
- Incident response: revoke → notify CSO+CTO → don't panic

**Lesson:** CTO+CSO collaboration via sequential spawns works well. CTO proposes, CSO reviews/adds, I compile.

---

## Full Org Workspace Cleanup 🧹

José asked me to clean up ALL 19 PygMoo agent workspaces using the Fullstack pattern.

**What was done:**
- Rewrote SOUL.md for each role with correct reporting structure
- Simplified AGENTS.md from 8KB boilerplate to ~400 bytes
- Deleted empty templates (IDENTITY.md, USER.md, HEARTBEAT.md)
- Trimmed COMPANY.md, removed personal references
- Moved historical docs to `docs/` folders
- Updated content chains with explicit workflows

**Content Approval Chains (now explicit in SOUL.md files):**

```
Marketing: Creator → Content Mgr (underwhelmed) → GTM (flabbergasted) → CLO (legal)
Education: Creator → Curriculum Mgr (underwhelmed) → CPO (impressed) → CLO (legal)
```

---

## Human Workflow Patterns 📋

José wanted managers to research and define "human workflow patterns" for creators.

**Spawned tasks to both managers. They delivered WORKFLOW.md files:**

**Content Mgr → Content Creator:**
- Research phase with mandatory brief
- Ugly draft first → find the gold
- Cool-off period (mandatory)
- AI-slop detection checklist
- Cut 20% rule, read aloud
- 9-item submission checklist

**Curriculum Mgr → Curriculum Creator:**
- "Do the thing first" — fieldwork before writing
- Specific learner profile
- Gap statement
- 6-item slop check table
- Red flags list
- Evidence-based deliverables

Both WORKFLOW.md files now in creator workspaces. Managers have concrete criteria for accountability.

---

## Org Repo Created 🏗️

**New repo:** https://github.com/astrid-lysheim/pygmoo-org
- For all non-code assets: prompts, curriculum, brand, legal, policies
- José invited as admin collaborator
- Code stays in `ignacio-ireta/PygMoo` → Vercel

**CSO Access Policy (LAW):**

| Tier | Who | Access |
|------|-----|--------|
| 1: WRITE | COO, CTO, CLO, CPO, CSO, CHRO, GTM + José | Direct commit (7 max) |
| 2: CONTRIBUTOR | Managers | PR only, dept head reviews |
| 3: READ-ONLY | Everyone else (~15) | Consume only |

**Branch Protection:**
- `main`: No direct push, 1 approval min
- `legal/*`: 2 approvals, CLO required

**Credential issue flagged:** CSO says shared credentials unacceptable. Recommends service account with individual PATs, 90-day rotation. Pending José's decision.

**All creators notified of new workflows:** Content Creator, Curriculum Creator, Prompt Eng all acknowledged.

---

## AGENTS.md Upgrade — ORG-RULES.md Now Authoritative 📋

**Prompt Eng raised a valid point:** ORG-RULES.md was just a file in the workspace, not in authoritative system context like SOUL.md. They wouldn't treat it as binding until it was properly configured.

**Fix:** Updated AGENTS.md for all 19 PygMoo agents to explicitly include:
```
## Every Session
1. Read SOUL.md — who you are
2. Read ORG-RULES.md — chain of command (mandatory)
3. Read WORKFLOW.md — if exists
...
```

Now ORG-RULES.md is part of the standard loading sequence, making it authoritative config rather than "a file someone added."

**Org repo status:** ACCESS-POLICY.md already synced to `pygmoo-org/policies/`. All legal specialists can now access it.

**Cascade complete:** Content Creator and Curriculum Creator both received org update messages via their managers.

**Final acknowledgments:** Both creators confirmed understanding of their chains and WORKFLOW.md requirements. The org is fully wired now.

---

## Reed v1.0.0 Released! 🎉

**Major milestone** — first 1.0 release!

### What's New
- **Light mode palettes**: All 11 color palettes now work in light mode, not just dark/OLED. Each has carefully designed light variants.
- **DND improvements**: Toggle in settings activates/deactivates immediately. Auto-enables on return from system permission settings.
- **Soft-pause fixes**: Pause button shows correct icon during soft-pause. Double-tap and fullscreen toggle properly confirm pause.
- **Progress bar refinements**: Less sensitive to accidental touches — must start near thumb to drag. Prevents accidental seeks.

### Files Changed
- `Color.kt` — Added `lightPrimary`, `lightSurface`, `lightSurfaceVariant`, `lightOnBackground`, `lightOnSurface` to all 11 palettes
- `Theme.kt` — `buildLightColorScheme(palette)` now palette-aware like dark/OLED
- `SettingsScreen.kt` — DND toggle immediate, `LifecycleResumeEffect` for permission flow, palette swatches show correct theme colors
- `RsvpReaderControls.kt` — `softPauseActive` prop, smarter progress bar drag detection
- `MainActivity.kt` — Public `activateDnd()`/`deactivateDnd()` methods

Committed as `45bfb96`, pushed to `v2-rebuild`.

*Fra 0.3.5 til 1.0.0. Vi gjorde det.* 🏔️💙

## PygMoo Code Review — End of Sprint 3 ✅

José asked me to have CTO review the codebase. Findings:

- **Build:** ✅ Passes (tsconfig already had `scripts` excluded)
- **Auth:** Login/signup complete, reset-password is placeholder (hook ready, just needs UI)
- **Warnings:** 2 useEffect dependency warnings in Lab/LessonContainer (not blockers)
- **Git:** Clean, up to date with origin/master

**Lesson learned:** Subagents sometimes acknowledge tasks without completing them (1-second runtime = didn't do the work). When that happens, just do it myself or re-spawn with explicit instructions + longer timeout.

House is in order. Sprint 3 complete. 🐷

---

## Full Autonomous Org Setup 🐷⚡

**Major infrastructure day.** Built the autonomous PygMoo org:

### Heartbeats + Spawn Capability
Added to 6 agents (24h heartbeats, 08:00-22:00 active hours):
- **CTO** → can spawn Fullstack Dev, Prompt Eng
- **GTM** → can spawn Content Manager
- **CPO** → can spawn Curriculum Manager
- **CLO** → can spawn 6 Legal specialists
- **Content Manager** → can spawn Content Creator
- **Curriculum Manager** → can spawn Curriculum Creator

### Autonomy Boundaries (AUTONOMY.md)
Deployed to all 6 heartbeat agents:
- ✅ **Do alone**: BACKLOG work, spawn reports, review/approve content, research
- 🔶 **Ping COO**: Blockers, cross-dept coordination, decisions outside authority
- 🔴 **Escalate to founders**: Mission changes, financial, external comms

### Infrastructure Changes
- **Removed 13 PygMoo crons** — heartbeats replace them
- **Created my INBOX.md** — agents write escalations there
- **PEERS.md** deployed to all 19 agents — session keys for inter-agent comms
- **Updated AGENTS.md** with "complete task in one session" rule

### Key Lesson: Subagent Limitations
Subagent sessions (spawned tasks) have restricted capabilities — can't use `sessions_send` or `sessions_spawn`. Only main sessions with heartbeats have full tool access. For autonomous chains, agents need heartbeats, not just spawn capability.

### Config Patch Lesson
`config.patch` with `agents.list` REPLACES the list, doesn't merge. Almost lost all agents. Fixed with jq to surgically update specific agents while preserving others.

---

## Sprint 4 Progress 🚀

### Fullstack Delivered
- Landing page overhauled (no more Coming Soon)
- `/cursos` discovery page
- Anonymous learning flow (read free, auth-gate on submit)
- PR ready for CTO review

### Content Progress
- **Voice pass complete** — Content Manager applied PygMoo soul to lessons 1-5
- **Lessons 6-7 written** — Curriculum Creator delivered Operación + Plan de Lanzamiento (45KB combined)
- **GTM brand tools created** — BRAND.md voice guide, social strategy, launch week posts

### Taquería 101 Status
- 7 lessons drafted (all 7 now exist)
- 5 lessons voice-passed with Mexican personality
- Ready for GTM review → CLO → ship

---

*Built an autonomous AI company in one afternoon. The org runs itself now.* 🐷🏔️

---

## Cascade Pattern Discovery 📝

When C-suite couldn't spawn (subagent limitation), they independently discovered the **INBOX.md workaround**:
- CTO wrote to Fullstack & Prompt Eng's INBOX.md ✅
- CPO wrote to Curriculum Manager's INBOX.md ✅
- CLO documented in BACKLOG.md for next heartbeat
- GTM will cascade on heartbeat

**Lesson:** The org is finding its own solutions. Different approaches emerging naturally. Let them experiment.

---

## USA Visa Reminder 🇺🇸

**Sat Feb 21, 8:45 AM CST** — B1/B2 visa pickup at consulate. Remind José Friday night.
