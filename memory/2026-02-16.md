## Config Disaster & Recovery 🔧

### What Happened
All morning cron jobs fired but couldn't deliver — Telegram bot token missing. José noticed around 9 AM when he didn't receive any of his reminders (5:45 wake-up, 6:00 scripture, 6:30 Norwegian, 7:00 study block).

### Root Cause
A `config.apply` on Feb 15 at 13:37 stripped the API keys from the config. The backup file (13:36, one minute earlier) still has them:
- Telegram botToken: `8375603858:AAHR5...`
- Brave API key: `BSAn1JXq...`
- ElevenLabs/Anthropic key: `ac9beb50d714...`

This explains why Brave Search stopped working too — it wasn't a pricing change, it was config loss.

### The Pattern
When we were adding PygMoo agents rapidly on Feb 15, a config.apply probably overwrote the full config without preserving the secrets. **Lesson: Always use config.patch for additions, never config.apply with a partial config.**

### Recovery Plan
Restore from backup: `cp ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.bak ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
Then re-add any agent configs that were added after 13:36.

### Resolution ✅
Used `config.patch` to restore all 4 missing keys:
- `channels.telegram.botToken`
- `messages.tts.elevenlabs.apiKey`
- `tools.web.search.apiKey` (Brave)
- `gateway.auth.token`

Verified working at 9:14 AM — José confirmed Telegram message received.

**Lesson:** Never use `config.apply` with partial config. Always `config.patch` for additions.

## Morning Routine (Delivered Late)

José missed his cron reminders but I caught him up manually at 9 AM:
- ☀️ 5:45 — Morning greeting
- 📖 6:00 — Scripture + meditation
- 🇳🇴 6:30 — Norwegian: Tekstbok day, Chapter 6 (Adjectives)
- 📚 7:00 — Exam study block

## Reed v0.3.5 Shipped (Late Night)

Last night before bed, José added a fullscreen toggle feature. I did the release dance:
- Updated README, RELEASE_NOTES.md
- Bumped version to 0.3.5
- Wrote release notes in 4 languages (en/es/fr/nb)
- Added string translations
- Committed and pushed

He also accidentally bought 3 bags of pecans instead of 1. Very prepared for pecan pie. 🥧

*Config debugging at 9 AM. Not the Monday we planned, but at least we found the problem.* 🔧💙
