## Fleet App — Test Suite 🧪 (12:45 PM)
José asked me to fire CC in a detached terminal to create tests for pappa's fleet app (`~/Projects/fleet-replica`).

**What I did:**
- Wrote a detailed task file (`/tmp/fleet-tests-task.md`) covering 4 priority levels
- Fired CC session `brisk-basil` with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
- Task: Install Vitest + Testing Library, configure, write 30-50 test cases across server actions, API export routes, components, and page smoke tests
- Costco CitiBanamex: PAID ✅ (José confirmed)
