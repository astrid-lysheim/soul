## Part 1: Wozniak's 20 Rules — The Foundation

Piotr Wozniak created SuperMemo (the first SRS software, 1987) and distilled decades of experience into 20 rules for formulating knowledge. These are the bedrock:

### The Most Important Rules (in order of impact)

**Rule 1: Do not learn if you do not understand.**
Trying to memorize material you don't comprehend is "blind learning" — astronomically slow and essentially useless. Understanding MUST precede memorization.

**Rule 2: Learn before you memorize.**
Build the big picture first. Read the chapter, understand the system, THEN create cards for individual pieces. Isolated facts without context are like single words from a foreign textbook — they don't stick.

**Rule 3: Build upon the basics.**
Don't neglect "obvious" things. Basics take microscopic review time but each lapse costs dearly. The 50/5 rule: you typically spend 50% of review time on just 3-5% of material. Basics should NOT be in that 3-5%.

**Rule 4: Minimum information principle.**
THE most violated rule. Each card should test ONE atomic piece of knowledge. Complex cards with multiple facts ALWAYS cause problems:
- The brain takes different paths through the "labyrinth" each time
- Different synaptic connections activate each repetition
- Scheduling becomes impossible (the hard sub-item drags down the easy ones)

Classic example: Instead of "What are the characteristics of the Dead Sea?" (requires reciting 8 facts), create 8 separate cards, each testing one fact.

**Rule 5: Cloze deletion is easy and effective.**
A sentence with a gap: "Norwegian has ___ grammatical genders" → "three". Quick to create, focuses on one fact, provides context. The workhorse of efficient card creation.

**Rule 6: Use imagery.**
Visual cortex is evolutionarily overdeveloped compared to verbal processing. Images are "worth a thousand words" for memory too. A map of Tanzania beats "What country is between Kenya, Zambia and Mozambique?"

**Rule 7: Use mnemonic techniques.**
Needed for only 1-5% of items with practice — the hard-to-remember outliers.

### Secondary Rules (8-20, key selections)

**Rule 8: Avoid sets and enumerations.**
"Name the countries of the EU" is a memory nightmare. Convert to individual cards or use overlapping cloze deletions.

**Rule 9: Avoid the word "and."**
"And" in an answer usually means the card should be split.

**Rule 10: Use redundancy.**
Approach the same knowledge from multiple angles. Different card types for the same fact strengthen the memory network.

**Rule 13: Personalize and provide examples.**
Personal connections dramatically strengthen encoding. "hytte = cabin, like the one we'll have near Bergen" >> "hytte = cabin."

**Rule 14: Rely on emotional states.**
Emotion strengthens memory. Funny, surprising, or personally meaningful cards are remembered better.

**Rule 17: Redundancy does not contradict minimum information.**
You CAN have multiple simple cards about the same topic. Many simple > few complex.

## Part 2: Card Types for Language Learning

### The Card Type Spectrum

Based on Wyner, Louis Li, Refold, and community consensus:

#### 1. Word Cards (Basic)
- Front: L1 word or image
- Back: L2 word
- **Pros:** Simple, fast to create
- **Cons:** No context, multiple meanings ambiguous, doesn't show usage
- **Best for:** Absolute beginners (first 500-1000 words)

#### 2. Sentence Cards
- Front: Full L2 sentence (target word highlighted or underlined)
- Back: Definition of target word
- **Pros:** Shows word in context, teaches grammar passively, demonstrates usage patterns
- **Cons:** Can pass by pattern-matching context instead of knowing the word
- **Best for:** Intermediate learners, sentence mining from immersion

#### 3. Cloze Deletion Cards
- Front: L2 sentence with gap: "Jeg ___ til Oslo i går" (gikk)
- Back: The missing word
- **Pros:** Tests production, forces recall, easy to create, one fact per card
- **Cons:** Can sometimes be guessed from context without real knowledge; may produce shallower understanding than Q&A
- **Best for:** Grammar drilling, collocations, verb forms, prepositions

#### 4. Production Cards (Wyner)
- Front: Image + L2 definition (no L1!)
- Back: L2 word
- **Pros:** Forces thinking IN the target language, builds L2→L2 connections
- **Cons:** Requires intermediate vocabulary to understand L2 definitions
- **Best for:** Advanced beginners onward (once you have ~1000 words)

#### 5. Comprehension Cards (Wyner)
- Front: L2 word
- Back: Image + example sentence
- **Pros:** Tests recognition, provides rich context on back
- **Cons:** Easier than production — recognition ≠ production ability
- **Best for:** Vocabulary breadth, passive recognition

#### 6. Root Form Cards (Wyner, newer)
- Front: Conjugated form in context → "What's the infinitive?"
- Back: Root form (e.g., sacudir → sacudió)
- **Pros:** Builds connections between word forms, aids morphological awareness
- **Best for:** Languages with rich morphology (Norwegian verb classes, noun declensions)

#### 7. Definition Cards (Wyner, newer)
- Front: L2 definition only (no example sentence)
- Back: L2 word
- **Pros:** Forces engagement with L2 definitions, connects old vocabulary to new
- **Cons:** Requires substantial vocabulary
- **Best for:** B1+ learners, building L2-internal network

### The Verdict: Which Type for José?

Given his A2-B1 level, ASD profile, and our teaching approach:

**Phase 1 (Current, A2-B1): Mixed approach**
- **Cloze deletions** for grammar (V2 word order, verb forms, adjective agreement)
- **Image + L2 word cards** for concrete vocabulary
- **Sentence cards** for abstract vocabulary and collocations
- **Separate production and comprehension cards** for key words

**Phase 2 (B1-B2): Shift toward L2-only**
- **Production cards with L2 definitions** become primary
- **Sentence mining from NRK** for authentic vocabulary
- **Cloze deletions** for complex grammar (subordinate clauses, double determination)

---

## Part 3: The Sentence Mining Approach

### Refold's Framework

Sentence mining = finding new words in authentic content and creating cards from the sentences you found them in. Core principles:

**The 1T Rule:** A good sentence card should have exactly ONE unknown element (1T = "one target"). If multiple words are unknown, don't use that sentence.

**Perfect comprehension test:** After looking up the unknown word, the entire sentence should make sense. If it doesn't, the sentence is too complex.

**When to mine:** During intensive reading/listening (already doing lookups). Synchronous mining (create cards as you go) is most popular.

**How many new cards per day:** 10 is the recommended starting point. Multiply by 7 for estimated daily reviews (10 new/day → ~70 reviews/day after stabilization).

### Why Sentences Beat Isolated Words

1. **Disambiguates meaning** — most words have multiple senses; the sentence narrows to one
2. **Concrete over abstract** — sentence provides a mental image; isolated word is abstract
3. **Shows usage** — collocations, prepositions, word order
4. **Grammar for free** — sentence structure teaches grammar passively alongside vocabulary

### Practical Mining Sources for Norwegian

- NRK articles (daily reads — already in HEARTBEAT.md!)
- På vei / Stein på stein textbook sentences
- Norwegian podcasts with transcripts
- FINN.no listings (apartment hunting — connects to task bank!)
- Norwegian social media / Reddit r/norge

## Part 4: Common Mistakes (The Anti-Patterns)

### Mistake 1: Too-Complex Cards
The #1 killer. A card testing "describe the Norwegian gender system" is 10 cards in a trench coat. Split ruthlessly.

### Mistake 2: L1→L2 Only (Ignoring L2→L1)
Louis Li's hard-won lesson: He learned 3,000 Russian words L2→L1 (recognition) and later couldn't USE any of them. The brain cheats: "There's a card in this deck that means 'to believe' and this looks vaguely like it." Production cards (L1→L2) are harder but far more useful for active vocabulary.

**However:** Both directions have value. Recognition cards build passive vocabulary (reading/listening); production cards build active vocabulary (writing/speaking). The key is creating BOTH, not one or the other.

### Mistake 3: Isolated Words Without Collocations
"jump" is useless alone. "jump over," "jump on," "jump up" are what you actually need. Norwegian equivalent: "tro" (believe) vs "tro på" (believe in). Always include the preposition or particle.

For Norwegian specifically:
- "reise **til**" (travel to) — not just "reise"
- "glad **i**" (fond of) — not just "glad"
- "tenke **på**" (think about) — not just "tenke"

### Mistake 4: Not Punishing "Small" Mistakes
Louis Li's anecdote: In St. Petersburg, getting ONE vowel wrong in "решил" made his conversation partner unable to understand after 5 repetitions. Hit "Again" for even small errors. For Norwegian, this is critical — vowel length distinctions (tak/takk, ful/full) are phonemic.

### Mistake 5: Skipping Audio
Leads to: can read the word but can't pronounce it; can't recognize it when heard. Add audio to EVERY card. Use Forvo.com for human pronunciations, or TTS as fallback.

### Mistake 6: Only Making Cards You "Need"
Louis Li's insight: Make cards for things you UNDERSTAND but wouldn't SAY. The gap between passive comprehension and active production is huge. If you read a phrase and understand it instantly but wouldn't produce it yourself, make a card.

### Mistake 7: Spending Too Much Time Making Cards
Controversial but practical: pre-made decks + personal modifications >> crafting every card from scratch. The ideal is custom cards from personal immersion, but if the choice is between 50 perfect custom cards and 500 "good enough" frequency-list cards, the 500 win.

## Part 5: FSRS — The Algorithm Revolution

### What Changed

The old Anki algorithm (SM-2) was created by a college student in 1987 based on personal experiments. It used arbitrary rules: see card after 1 day → 6 days → multiply by 2.5 on success → reset to 1 on failure.

**FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler)** by Jarrett Ye, integrated into Anki since v23.10, uses machine learning to model three things per card:
1. **Difficulty** (1-10, per card)
2. **Stability** (how long until recall probability drops to 90%)
3. **Retrievability** (current probability of recall)

These are fitted to YOUR personal review data using 21 parameters. Instead of one-size-fits-all exponential backoff, it models YOUR forgetting curve.

### Key Settings

**Desired retention:** The fraction of cards you want to recall correctly when due. Range: 0.70-0.97.
- **Default:** 0.90 (90%)
- **Recommended for language learning:** 0.85-0.90
- **Lower retention (0.75-0.80):** Fewer reviews, more cards memorized, but more forgetting — works for massive passive vocabulary building
- **Higher retention (0.90-0.95):** More reviews per card, but better recall — works for high-stakes active vocabulary

**Optimize parameters:** Run the optimizer after accumulating 1000+ reviews. It adjusts all 21 parameters to fit your personal learning patterns.

### Why FSRS Matters for José

- **No more "ease hell"** — SM-2's ease factor could permanently drop, creating leeches. FSRS models each card independently.
- **Personalized scheduling** — adapts to HIS learning speed, not a generic formula.
- **Better after failure** — instead of resetting to day 1, FSRS models relearning more intelligently.
- **Less frustration** — cards don't ping-pong between very long and very short intervals.

### Practical Setup

1. Install Anki (latest version has FSRS built in)
2. Enable FSRS in deck options
3. Start reviewing — accumulate 1000+ reviews
4. Run optimizer to personalize parameters
5. Set desired retention to 0.90 for active vocab, 0.85 for passive vocab

## Part 6: Cloze Deletions — The Nuanced View

### Andy Matuschak's Critique

Cloze deletions produce SHALLOWER understanding than well-crafted Q&A pairs because:
1. They contain extraneous information that serves as "hints"
2. They capture only one angle on an idea
3. They're usually narrative prose, not focused on one atomic unit
4. Less effortful to create = less processing during creation
5. Often have ambiguity problems — syntactic structure suggests the answer without genuine recall

### The Counterargument

Cloze deletions are an "extremely efficient way to produce new prompts." The limiting factor in SRS capacity is WRITING ENOUGH GOOD PROMPTS. If the choice is between cloze prompts and nothing at all, cloze wins.

### My Synthesis for Norwegian Teaching

**Use cloze deletions for:**
- Grammar patterns: "I går ___ jeg til butikken" (gikk) — tests V2 inversion
- Verb conjugations: "Vi har ___ en film" (sett) — tests participle
- Prepositions: "Jeg er glad ___ deg" (i) — tests collocation
- Gender: "Jeg kjøpte ___ bok" (en) — tests article

**Use Q&A pairs for:**
- Vocabulary with depth: "What Norwegian word means 'a cabin in the mountains'?" (hytte)
- Grammar rules: "In subordinate clauses, where does 'ikke' go?" (before the verb)
- Cultural knowledge: "What is a dugnad?" (community volunteer work tradition)

**Use image cards for:**
- Concrete nouns (especially with gender color-coding)
- Verbs with clear actions
- Prepositions (visual spatial relationships)

## Part 7: Norwegian-Specific Card Design

### Gender Color-Coding System

Following Wyner's visual approach, with colors for Norwegian's three genders:

| Gender | Color | Article | Example Card |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|
| Masculine (en) | 🔵 Blue | en | Blue background: [image of book] → "en bok" |
| Feminine (ei/en) | 🩷 Pink | ei/en | Pink background: [image of girl] → "ei jente" |
| Neuter (et) | 🟢 Green | et | Green background: [image of house] → "et hus" |

Color coding leverages visual cortex (Wozniak Rule 6) and creates a pattern system (ASD-friendly from Feb 13 session).

### Card Templates for Norwegian Grammar

**V2 Word Order (cloze):**
- "I morgen ___ jeg til Oslo" (reiser) — forces production of correct V2
- "Etter frokost ___ vi en tur" (tar) — tests inversion after fronted adverbial

**Subordinate Clause Order (cloze):**
- "Han sier at han ___ liker kaffe" (ikke) — tests adverb placement in subclause
- "Fordi vi ___ har tid, blir vi hjemme" (ikke) — contrast with main clause

**Definite Forms (production):**
- [image of specific book] → "boken" (the book) — tests suffixed article
- [image of the house] → "huset" (the house) — tests neuter definite

**Double Determination (cloze):**
- "___ store boken er på bordet" (Den) — tests determiner + suffix together

**Minimal Pairs for Vowels:**
- Audio: [tak] → "What word? What does it mean?" → "tak = roof" vs "takk = thanks"
- Ear training cards with audio on front, word + meaning on back

### Frequency-Based Deck Structure

Available Norwegian frequency decks on AnkiWeb:
- **"6000 Most Frequent Norwegian Words"** (Parts 1-3) — comprehensive, sorted by frequency
- **"NORWEGIAN FREQUENCY LIST - Top 1000"** — quick starter

**My recommendation for José:** Don't use pre-made decks as primary. Instead:
1. Use frequency list as a REFERENCE to prioritize which words to learn
2. Create custom cards from textbook and NRK immersion
3. Supplement gaps with frequency list words he hasn't encountered naturally
4. All custom cards follow the design principles above (image + audio + example sentence + gender color)

## Part 8: The Practical Implementation Plan

### José's Anki System — Blueprint

**Deck Structure:**
```
Norwegian/
├── 01-Pronunciation/
│   ├── Minimal pairs (vowel length)
│   ├── Front rounded vowels (/y/, /ø/)
│   └── Retroflex consonants
├── 02-Vocabulary/
│   ├── På vei chapters (tagged by chapter)
│   ├── NRK sentence mining
│   └── Frequency gaps
├── 03-Grammar/
│   ├── V2 word order (cloze)
│   ├── Subordinate clauses (cloze)
│   ├── Verb conjugations (cloze)
│   ├── Definite forms (production)
│   └── Adjective agreement (cloze)
└── 04-Culture/
    ├── Norwegian traditions
    └── Test-relevant topics
```

**Daily Routine:**
- Morning: 15-20 min review (all due cards)
- After each lesson: Create 5-10 new cards from lesson material
- After NRK reading: Mine 2-3 sentences for new vocabulary
- Total new cards: ~10-15/day → ~70-105 reviews/day after stabilization

**Card Creation Workflow:**
1. Encounter new word/pattern in lesson or NRK
2. Find/create example sentence (prefer authentic)
3. Search Google Images for visual
4. Get audio from Forvo or TTS
5. Create card with: image + audio + example sentence + gender color
6. Tag by source (paaVei-ch3, nrk, steinPaaStein, etc.)

**Settings:**
- Enable FSRS
- Desired retention: 0.90
- New cards/day: 10 (adjustable)
- Learning steps: 1m 10m (short-term), then FSRS handles long-term
- Run optimizer after first 1000 reviews

### Integration with Teaching Sessions

| Session Type | Anki Integration |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Day 1 (Tekstbok) | Preview vocabulary cards for the chapter BEFORE reading |
| Day 2 (Arbeidsbok) | Create grammar cloze cards from exercise patterns |
| Day 3 (My Lesson) | Create production cards + story vocabulary cards post-lesson |
| NRK Daily Read | Mine 2-3 sentences |
| Heartbeat | Check Anki stats for retention rate, adjust if needed |

## Key Insights Summary

1. **Minimum information principle is king.** One fact per card. Split ruthlessly.
2. **Both directions matter.** Recognition AND production cards for active vocabulary.
3. **Sentences > words.** Context disambiguates, teaches grammar, shows usage.
4. **Audio on every card.** Can't produce what you can't hear (especially critical for Norwegian vowels).
5. **Images beat translations.** Visual encoding is stronger than verbal.
6. **FSRS > SM-2.** Enable it, optimize it, trust it.
7. **Cloze for grammar, Q&A for vocabulary depth.** Each has its sweet spot.
8. **Collocations, not isolated words.** "glad i" not "glad." "reise til" not "reise."
9. **Mine from immersion.** Personal, contextual cards > generic frequency lists.
10. **Punish small mistakes.** One vowel off in Norwegian can mean a different word.
