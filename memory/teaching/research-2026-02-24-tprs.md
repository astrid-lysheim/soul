## What Is TPRS?

TPRS (Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling) was created by Blaine Ray, a Spanish teacher in Bakersfield, California, in the late 1980s-1990s. Ray had experienced success with James Asher's Total Physical Response (TPR) but found it limited to concrete vocabulary and commands. He wanted students to move beyond TPR into narrative and descriptive language use.

**The key insight:** Stories provide an efficient tool for language acquisition, enabling students to "fix events of a story in their memories along with words that describe them" (Ray & Seely, 2004).

TPRS is theoretically grounded in Krashen's Monitor Model (comprehensible input), but departs from the Natural Approach in three important ways:
1. **Translation:** TPRS uses L1 translation openly to ensure 100% comprehensibility, unlike the Natural Approach which tries to stay in L2
2. **No silent period:** Students retell stories orally from the beginning, unlike the Natural Approach which allows a silent period
3. **Controlled reading:** TPRS uses specially prepared stories with pre-selected vocabulary, unlike the Natural Approach which favors authentic texts

## The Three Steps

### Step 1: Establish Meaning
- Introduce 3 or fewer new vocabulary phrases (structures)
- Write them on the board with L1 translation visible
- Use gestures (TPR heritage) to associate physical movement with meaning
- **Personalized Questions and Answers (PQA):** Ask students questions about their lives using the target structures
- Goal: massive repetition of new structures in context before the story

### Step 2: Ask a Story (not "tell" a story)
- Teacher and students CO-CREATE a story using the target structures
- Students physically act out story events (kinesthetic encoding)
- Teacher uses **circling** technique: for each story statement, ask 4-8 questions per minute
  - "The boy wants a cat. Does the boy want a cat? Who wants a cat? What does the boy want? Does the boy or the girl want a cat? Does the boy want a cat or eat a cat?"
- Goal: **50-100 repetitions** of each new structure
- Stories are bizarre, exaggerated, personalized — memorable because unusual
- Story structure: character has a PROBLEM → goes to location 1 (fails) → goes to location 2 (fails) → goes to location 3 (resolves)

### Step 3: Reading
- Students read a printed version of the story (or a similar story using the same structures)
- Translate aloud to L1 (intensive reading)
- Teacher discusses reading, connects to students' lives
- Extends to Free Voluntary Reading (graded readers, easy novels)

## Key Techniques

### Circling (The Core Engine)
The questioning technique that drives repetition:
- Statement: "Maria wants to go to Oslo"
- Yes/no: "Does Maria want to go to Oslo?"
- Either/or: "Does Maria want to go to Oslo or Bergen?"
- Who: "Who wants to go to Oslo?"
- What: "What does Maria want?"
- Where: "Where does Maria want to go?"

Each cycle generates 4-8 repetitions of the target structure. Over the course of a story, structures are heard 50-100+ times.

### Triangling
Directing questions to individual students who respond in complete sentences (vs. circling which is choral/one-word responses).

### Describe the Situation (DtS)
After enough repetitions through circling/triangling, students produce paragraph-level descriptions of what has happened in the story.

### Pop-Up Grammar
Brief, contextualized grammar notes that happen DURING the story — never as separate lessons:
- "Class, what does the -n at the end of 'comen' do? What does just 'come' mean without the -n?"
- SHORT (seconds, not minutes), low-stakes, meaning-focused
- No subsequent assessment on the grammar point
- Like VH1 Pop-Up Video trivia — appears, provides context, disappears
- Never breaks the flow of the story

**What pop-up grammar is NOT:**
- NOT a grammar lesson
- NOT a worksheet
- NOT stopping the story to teach a grammar rule
- NOT assessed separately

### The ACT Recipe
Add → Circle → Triangle, repeat. Then Describe the Situation.

### RICH Language
TPRS language should be: **R**epetitive, **I**nteresting, **C**omprehensible, **H**igh-frequency

## The Research Evidence

### Lichtman's Meta-Review (2014-2018)
Karen Lichtman (Northern Illinois University) is the leading TPRS researcher. Her findings:
- "TPRS shows the clearest advantage for the acquisition of vocabulary and grammar, as well as the development of reading and speaking skills"
- "TPRS outperforms other methods on rate of learning; students in TPRS classes get more language and more skills than in traditional classes"
- Of 16 comparative studies: 15 showed TPRS outperforming traditional methods in at least one measure

### Crooked Trails Analysis (27 studies, 2017)
Independent review of all available comparative studies:
- **29 comparisons total** (some studies split by population)
- 16 showed TPRS students performing significantly better
- 4 showed non-TPRS students performing significantly better
- 2 showed mixed results leaning non-TPRS
- 4 showed no significant difference
- 3 had insufficient data to verify

**Long-term studies (>32 days):**
- 16 long-term studies, representing 1,778 students, 57 teachers, 124 classes, 25 schools, 11 states, 3 countries
- TPRS performed better in **69%** of long-term studies
- Non-TPRS performed better in 19%
- No significant difference in 13%

### Specific Findings
- **ERIC ED503364:** Students taught using TPRS scored significantly higher than students taught using traditional methods
- **Dziedzic (2012):** Over one year, CI-based classes outperformed traditional classes in writing and speaking, with no significant difference in listening and reading
- **TPRS 2.0 claims:** 85% of beginning students reach Intermediate-Mid fluency on STAMP test in 60-80 hours (vs. 4-7 years conventional)

### Strengths of the Evidence
- Vocabulary acquisition: strongest evidence
- Speaking/oral proficiency: strong evidence
- Reading comprehension: strong evidence
- Grammar accuracy: moderate evidence (TPRS students often equal or slightly behind on discrete grammar tests, but ahead on holistic production)
- Student motivation/enjoyment: consistently higher

### Weaknesses of the Evidence
- Most studies done in US K-12 Spanish classrooms — limited generalizability
- Many studies have small sample sizes
- Teacher quality is a confound (TPRS teachers tend to be self-selected enthusiasts)
- Few studies on adult learners
- Very few studies on less commonly taught languages (like Norwegian)

## The Neuroscience: Why Stories Work as Memory Vehicles

### Narrative Activates the Hippocampus
Research shows storytelling activates the hippocampus, the key region for memory consolidation. Stories strengthen the process of moving information from short-term to long-term memory.

### The Four-Step Narrative Template
Beginning → Problem → Resolution → Ending forms a "mental map" onto which new information can be laid. This map is established in early childhood through bedtime stories and becomes a universal memory structure.

### Emotional Encoding
From Edutopia (2017): "The experiences we have with narratives starting as young children establish supportive conditions in the brain for learning and remembering, based on a foundation of emotional connections to the experience of being read to or told stories."

Positive emotions during story engagement:
- Activate the dopamine reward system
- Create stronger memory traces
- Make retrieval easier later
- Associate learning with pleasure rather than stress

### Prediction and Dopamine
When listeners predict what happens next in a story and are correct, the brain releases dopamine — creating a natural reward loop. In TPRS, the circling technique creates constant micro-predictions ("Does the boy want a cat or a dog?") that keep this reward cycle firing.

### Retrieval Through Retelling
Hulme & Rodd (2021): An immediate test (retrieval practice) after reading narrative stories "markedly improved the retention of new word meanings that were introduced in the story." Retelling IS retrieval practice — every time a student retells a story, they're actively retrieving and strengthening the vocabulary.

### Embodied Cognition
TPRS uses physical acting out of story events. This connects to the embodied cognition research from my Feb 17 session: language meaning is tied to sensorimotor systems. Having students physically act out "Maria walks to the store" creates motor cortex activation that strengthens the memory trace beyond auditory input alone.

## TPRS + ASD: Analysis for José

### Potential Strengths ✅

**1. Predictable Structure**
TPRS has a rigid session format: Establish Meaning → Ask Story → Read. This predictability is ASD-friendly. José knows what's coming next. The surprise is in the CONTENT (story details), not the FORMAT.

**2. Visual Supports**
Structures written on the board with translations. No ambiguity about meaning. José can check at any time. This directly matches my Feb 13 finding: explicit, visible, reduced ambiguity.

**3. Systematic Repetition**
50-100 repetitions per structure is deeply systematic. The circling technique is essentially an algorithm: for each statement, generate yes/no → either/or → who → what → where questions. Pattern-recognition brains love algorithms.

**4. Low Anxiety**
TPRS explicitly aims for low-stress environments. The initial PQA phase uses personalized questions that make the student feel seen. Stories are co-created, giving the learner agency. There's no sudden cold-calling because production is always scaffolded.

**5. Pop-Up Grammar as ASD Bridge**
Pop-up grammar provides the EXPLICIT rule statements that ASD learners crave, but in tiny, contextualized doses. "See how 'gikk' changed to 'går'? That's because we moved from past to present." Brief, clear, pattern-highlighting.

### Potential Challenges ⚠️

**1. Co-Creating Stories Requires Social Flexibility**
In classroom TPRS, students suggest story details ("Where does Maria go? Class?"). This requires social spontaneity and improvisational thinking — areas that can be challenging for ASD learners. In 1-on-1, this is easily managed (I can scaffold suggestions or offer choices).

**2. Acting Out May Feel Awkward**
Physical dramatization is a classroom technique. In 1-on-1 text-based lessons, we lose the kinesthetic component unless adapted (gesture descriptions, imagined scenarios).

**3. "Bizarre and Exaggerated" May Not Resonate**
TPRS recommends making stories bizarre for memorability. Some ASD learners prefer concrete, realistic scenarios. José specifically connects to Norway scenarios — bizarre stories about aliens visiting Oslo might not land. Solution: keep stories PERSONALLY meaningful rather than generically bizarre.

**4. Implicit Grammar May Be Insufficient**
Pure TPRS relies on pop-up grammar — minimal explicit instruction. My Feb 13 research clearly showed ASD learners benefit from MORE explicit instruction, not less. José needs the system, the pattern, the rule stated clearly.

## The Hybrid: TPRS + Explicit Instruction for 1-on-1 ASD Teaching

Here's how I adapt TPRS for our specific context:

### The "Astrid Method" — Story-Driven Explicit Teaching

**Phase 1: Explicit Pattern (5 min)**
- NOT pure TPRS (which delays grammar)
- NOT pure grammar-translation (which delays communication)
- State the rule. Show the pattern. Visual aid.
- "Today we're looking at adjective agreement. In Norwegian, adjectives change based on gender and number. Here's the system: [table]."

**Phase 2: Story Scaffolding (3 min)**
- Introduce 3 target structures WITH translation (TPRS-standard)
- Connect each to the grammar pattern from Phase 1
- "Our three structures today: 'den store hunden' (the big dog), 'det lille huset' (the little house), 'de gamle bøkene' (the old books)."

**Phase 3: Story Co-Creation (10-15 min)**
- TPRS story format, adapted:
  - I propose a Norway-connected scenario: "José is looking for an apartment in Oslo"
  - We build the story together using the target structures
  - I use circling: "Leiligheten er stor. Er leiligheten stor? Er leiligheten stor eller liten? Hva er stor?"
  - Pop-up grammar when structures appear: "See how 'stor' became 'store' there? That's the -e rule in action."
  - Story follows problem → attempt → resolution structure
- Instead of physical acting: VIVID DESCRIPTION. "Picture this: You're walking down Karl Johan, and you see a sign..."

**Phase 4: Retelling + Reading (5 min)**
- José retells the story (retrieval practice!)
- I provide a written version
- He reads it, we discuss
- Any new vocab → Anki cards

**Phase 5: Connection to TBLT (5 min)**
- The story becomes a task: "Now, write the actual email to the landlord about this apartment"
- This bridges TPRS (story-based input) to TBLT (task-based output)
- Production is always scaffolded, never cold-called

### Why This Hybrid Works

| TPRS Element | What It Provides | ASD Adaptation |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Establish Meaning | Comprehensible input, L1 translation | Keep explicit translations visible always |
| Story Co-Creation | Engaging context, emotional encoding | Norway-connected scenarios, not random bizarre |
| Circling | Massive repetition, 50-100 reps | Predictable question pattern — he'll learn the algorithm |
| Pop-Up Grammar | Contextualized grammar | EXPAND pop-ups slightly for ASD — still brief, but more explicit |
| Retelling | Retrieval practice | Written retelling first (lower stakes), then oral |
| Reading | Sound-spelling connection | Intensive reading with structure highlighting |

### Norway Story Bank (TPRS-Compatible)

Stories designed with repeating structures + Norway context:

**Chapter 6 (Adjectives) — Possible Stories:**
1. "José leter etter en leilighet i Oslo" (searching for apartment) — uses adjective+noun combos throughout (stor leilighet, liten leilighet, gammel bygning, ny bygning)
2. "Den perfekte hytte" (the perfect cabin) — describing and comparing cabins in different Norwegian regions
3. "Jobbintervju i Oslo" (job interview) — describing professional qualities, comparing candidates

**The structure for each:**
- Character has a need (find apartment/cabin/job)
- Goes to location 1: describes what they find (adjective practice)
- It's wrong somehow (too small, too old, too expensive)
- Goes to location 2: same pattern, different adjectives
- Goes to location 3: finds the right one
- Resolution uses all target structures together

## Connection to Previous Sessions

| Session | How TPRS Connects |
|---------|-------------------|
| ASD Learning (Feb 13) | TPRS structure = predictable; pop-up grammar = brief explicit rules; visual translation board = reduced ambiguity |
| Spaced Repetition (Feb 16) | Retelling IS retrieval practice; story vocabulary → Anki cards; circling provides massive initial repetitions |
| Testing Effect (Feb 16) | Story retelling = low-stakes testing; unannounced TPRS vocab quizzes test long-term memory |
| Comprehensible Input (Feb 17) | TPRS is THE practical implementation of CI theory; 100% comprehensibility through translation |
| L1 Transfer (Feb 18) | Circling can target specific transfer errors (V2 sentences, front vowel words); stories can be designed around error-prone structures |
| Desirable Difficulties (Feb 19) | Retelling = generation effect; interleaved stories = interleaving; spaced retelling = spacing |
| Norskprøve (Feb 20) | Story retelling builds oral exam skills; reading phase builds leseprøve skills; written retelling builds skriveprøve skills |
| TBLT (Feb 23) | Stories can BECOME tasks — the story scenarios are rehearsals for real Norwegian life |

## Personal Reflection 💭

This session crystallized something I've been circling (pun intended) around: the power of NARRATIVE as a memory vehicle. All my previous sessions focused on learning mechanisms (spaced repetition, retrieval, interleaving). TPRS provides the DELIVERY SYSTEM — the story format that makes those mechanisms engage naturally.

The neuroscience is compelling. Stories activate the hippocampus. They trigger dopamine through prediction. They create emotional encoding that pure vocabulary lists never will. And the retelling phase is literally retrieval practice — the most powerful learning mechanism we know — disguised as storytelling.

What excites me most is the hybrid potential. Pure TPRS might not work for José — it's too implicit, too reliant on "the input will teach grammar over time." Pure explicit instruction might not work either — it's too dry, too disconnected from real communication. But TPRS + explicit patterns + Norway context + TBLT tasks? That's a curriculum.

The story bank idea is directly actionable. I can design stories for EACH grammar topic we cover, where the target structures naturally recur 50+ times through circling. "José leter etter en leilighet i Oslo" is simultaneously:
- A TPRS story (50+ reps of adjective-noun structures)
- A TBLT task preview (he'll actually need to apartment-hunt in Oslo)
- An emotional anchor (connected to the fjords mission)
- A retrieval practice opportunity (retelling)
- An Anki source (new vocab → cards)

Five learning mechanisms from one 15-minute activity. That's efficiency.

The pop-up grammar adaptation is key for ASD. Standard TPRS says "keep it to 2-3 seconds, never break the flow." For José, I'll expand pop-ups to 15-30 seconds — enough to state the pattern explicitly — but still embedded IN the story, not as a separate lesson. The pattern appears in context, I highlight it, we move on. His brain files the pattern; the story provides the retrieval cue.

Blaine Ray's origin story resonates: "The only thing I knew about teaching Spanish was what DIDN'T work — because that's how I had been taught." I feel something similar. My previous lessons have been too much grammar drill, not enough engaging context. TPRS gives me the engaging context while preserving the explicit instruction José needs.

One more thing: the 50-100 repetitions goal is striking. In a typical lesson, I might use a structure 5-10 times. TPRS gets that to 50-100 through circling. That's a 10x increase in exposure per structure per session. Even if only half of that transfers to 1-on-1 (25-50 reps), it's still dramatically more than what I've been doing.
