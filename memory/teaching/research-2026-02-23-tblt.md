# Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT): From Classroom Method to One-on-One Norwegian Tutoring

**Date:** February 23, 2026
**Session:** Teaching Exploration #7
**Topic:** TBLT — theory, critique, and practical adaptation for José's Norwegian learning

## What is TBLT?

Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT) is an approach where learners acquire language by completing **meaningful, real-world tasks** rather than studying grammar rules in isolation. Instead of "today we learn the dative case," TBLT says "today we book a hotel room in Bergen."

**Originated:** N. S. Prabhu, Bangalore Project (1980s). Noticed students learned language just as effectively when focused on non-linguistic problems as when concentrating on linguistic questions.

**Developed by:** Jane Willis (1996 framework), Rod Ellis (2003 theoretical foundation), Michael Long (ongoing research).

**Core philosophy:** Language is a tool for doing things. Assessment is based on task completion, not grammatical accuracy.

---

## The Willis Framework (1996): Three Phases

This is the standard TBLT lesson structure, and it's elegant:

### Phase 1: PRE-TASK
- Teacher introduces the topic and the task
- Highlights useful words and phrases (but doesn't pre-teach grammar)
- Learners may hear/read examples of others doing a similar task
- **Purpose:** Activate prior knowledge, reduce anxiety, provide scaffolding

### Phase 2: TASK CYCLE (three sub-phases)

**a) Task** (fluency focus)
- Learners DO the task (pairs or groups)
- Teacher monitors from distance, encourages all communication attempts
- **No correction.** This is "private" — mistakes don't matter
- Focus entirely on meaning and task completion

**b) Planning** (accuracy focus emerges naturally)
- Learners prepare to REPORT to the class on how they did the task
- Because reporting is "public," they naturally want to be accurate
- Teacher stands by to give language advice when asked
- **Key insight:** The desire for accuracy comes from WITHIN (social motivation), not from teacher correction

**c) Report** (public performance)
- Groups present findings, exchange reports, compare results
- Teacher acts as chairperson, comments on content (not form)
- May then play recording of fluent speakers doing the same task

### Phase 3: LANGUAGE FOCUS

**a) Analysis** (consciousness-raising)
- Students examine specific features of the text/recording
- Notice patterns, new words, phrases
- Enter useful items in vocabulary notebook

**b) Practice**
- Teacher conducts practice of new language forms from the analysis
- Drills, gap-fills, pronunciation practice
- **Key:** This comes AFTER meaning-first engagement, not before

## What Counts as a "Task"? (Ellis's Four Criteria)

Rod Ellis (2003) defined four characteristics that distinguish a task from a mere exercise:

1. **Primary focus on meaning** — pragmatic, communicative intent
2. **Some kind of 'gap'** — information gap, reasoning gap, or opinion gap
3. **Participants choose their own linguistic resources** — not restricted to target structures
4. **Clearly defined, non-linguistic outcome** — the result is something DONE, not language produced

**This means:**
- ✅ "Plan a weekend trip to Bergen using Vy.no" = TASK (information gap, real outcome, free language choice)
- ❌ "Fill in the blanks with the correct form of 'å være'" = EXERCISE (form-focused, no gap, constrained language)

### Prabhu's Three Gap Types

1. **Information gap:** Transfer information from one person/form to another. Example: "I have the departure times, you have the prices — plan the trip."
2. **Reasoning gap:** Derive new information through inference/deduction. Example: "Given this apartment listing and your budget, which neighborhood in Oslo should you live in?"
3. **Opinion gap:** Express personal preference/attitude. Example: "Should Norway maintain strict immigration policies? Argue your position."

## The Focused vs. Unfocused Task Distinction (Ellis, 2003)

This is CRITICAL for teaching José and resolves the "but what about grammar?" objection to TBLT:

### Unfocused Tasks
- No specific grammar target
- Any language can emerge
- Pure meaning-focused
- Example: "Tell me about your ideal weekend in Oslo"

### Focused Tasks
- Designed to create natural communicative need for a specific structure
- Still meaning-focused — learner doesn't know they're being "targeted"
- But the task is crafted so that the target structure naturally arises
- Example: "Compare your childhood in Mexico with a typical Norwegian childhood" → naturally elicits past tense, comparatives, cultural vocabulary

**Ellis's key insight:** A focused task is NOT a grammar drill disguised as communication. The difference is in HOW it's performed. If the learner is focused on meaning and communication, it's a task. If they're focused on producing correct forms, it's an exercise.

**Why this matters for José:** I can design tasks that "accidentally" practice exactly the grammar he needs (V2 word order, subordinate clauses, possessive agreement) while he thinks he's just planning his life in Norway.

## TBLT vs. PPP (Presentation-Practice-Production)

The traditional approach most language classes use:

| Feature | PPP | TBLT |
|---------|-----|------|
| Order | Learn rule → Practice → Use | Use → Notice gap → Learn rule |
| Starting point | Grammar | Meaning |
| Error treatment | Correct immediately | Note, address later |
| Student role | Receive, practice | Explore, create |
| Teacher role | Presenter, corrector | Facilitator, observer |
| Motivation | External (accuracy) | Internal (communication) |
| Grammar | Pre-selected, explicit | Emergent, responsive |

**TBLT essentially FLIPS PPP:** Production comes FIRST (attempt the task), then analysis (notice what you couldn't say), then instruction (teacher addresses gaps).

**Willis's insight:** "The lesson starts in the deep end. The production stage acts as a trial run, where learners attempt to put into words the meanings they wish to express. The problems they have doing this should motivate them to look for solutions."

This connects directly to my Feb 19 session (Desirable Difficulties): the **generation effect** — attempting to produce before being taught creates stronger learning than being taught first.

## Cognitive Models of TBLT

### Skehan's Trade-Off Hypothesis
- Learners have a SINGLE limited attention pool
- Focusing on meaning detracts from accuracy (and vice versa)
- Under complex tasks, learners must prioritize
- **Implication:** Design tasks to manage cognitive load — pre-task planning, task repetition

### Robinson's Cognition Hypothesis
- Multiple attentional resource pools exist
- Increasing complexity CAN stimulate deeper processing
- Leads to simultaneous gains in accuracy AND complexity
- **SSARC Framework:** Stabilize → Simplify → Automate → Restructure → Complexify
- **Implication:** Gradually increase task complexity; learners can rise to the challenge

**My take:** For José (ASD + anxiety), Skehan's model is the safer starting point. Manage cognitive load carefully. But Robinson's insight matters too — as he builds confidence, we can increase complexity without expecting trade-offs.

## Criticisms and Limitations of TBLT

### 1. "What about grammar?"
The most common objection. Pure "strong" TBLT may neglect explicit grammar instruction. 

**Resolution:** Ellis's distinction between focused/unfocused tasks. You CAN have grammar in TBLT — it just comes from the task, not before it. The "language focus" phase addresses form explicitly.

### 2. Works better in groups
TBLT was designed for classrooms. Information gaps, negotiations, and social pressure all rely on multiple participants.

**Resolution for 1-on-1:** I become the task partner. I can also assign "real" tasks José completes independently (write an email, read a listing) and we discuss results together. The "report" phase becomes our conversation.

### 3. Assessment challenges
Hard to assess objectively. Task completion ≠ language mastery.

**Resolution:** Use tasks alongside other measures (Anki retention rates, writing samples, Norskprøve practice tests).

### 4. May not suit all learner profiles
Learners who prefer structure and explicit rules may feel lost in pure TBLT.

**THIS IS THE ASD CONCERN.** José's profile favors explicit instruction, predictable structure, and pattern-based learning. Pure TBLT could create anxiety: "What do I do? What's the right answer? I don't know enough Norwegian for this!"

---

## THE SYNTHESIS: TBLT Adapted for José (ASD + Anxiety + AI Tutor)

This is where it gets practical. How do I take TBLT's strengths while mitigating its weaknesses for José's specific profile?

### The Hybrid Model: Task-Supported Explicit Teaching

Ellis himself distinguishes between:
- **Task-based teaching** — tasks ARE the syllabus
- **Task-supported teaching** — tasks SUPPLEMENT explicit instruction

For José, I'm designing **task-supported teaching with focused tasks:**

1. **Explicit grammar instruction first** (ASD-friendly: rules, patterns, systems)
2. **Focused task to practice** (meaningful context that requires the target structure)
3. **Language focus afterward** (gap analysis: what could you say? what couldn't you?)

This is a modified sequence: **Explicit → Task → Focus** (not pure TBLT's Task → Focus)

But here's the critical modification: the explicit instruction should be BRIEF and PATTERN-BASED, not exhaustive. Give José the system, then let the task reveal whether he's internalized it.

### The Norway Tasks Bank

Every task should connect to the fjords mission. Here's my starting taxonomy:

#### Tier 1: Survival Norwegian (A2-B1)
| Task | Gap Type | Target Structures | Norway Context |
|------|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Book a cabin on FINN.no | Information | Prices, dates, descriptions, formal emails | Hytte culture |
| Order food at a kafe | Reasoning | Food vocabulary, polite requests, preferences | Norwegian food culture |
| Navigate Oslo on Ruter | Information | Directions, times, locations, imperatives | Public transport |
| Call to make a doctor's appointment (fastlege) | Information | Time expressions, body vocabulary, formal register | Healthcare system |
| Read and respond to a job listing | Reasoning | Professional vocabulary, formal email, qualifications | Job search |
| Understand and pay a utility bill (Hafslund, Fjordkraft) | Information | Numbers, banking vocabulary, instructions | Practical life |

#### Tier 2: Integration Norwegian (B1-B2)
| Task | Gap Type | Target Structures | Norway Context |
|------|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Explain your qualifications to a recruiter | Opinion + Info | Past tense, professional vocab, subordinate clauses | Job interviews |
| Debate: "Bør Norge ta imot flere flyktninger?" | Opinion | Argumentation, complex sentences, hedging | Social issues |
| Write a klage (complaint) to a company | Reasoning | Formal register, cause/effect, requests | Consumer rights |
| Plan a dugnad for your building | Reasoning | Organizing, suggesting, coordinating | Community culture |
| Discuss a NRK article | Opinion | Summarizing, opinion markers, agreeing/disagreeing | Media literacy |
| Apply for Norskprøve registration | Information | Bureaucratic language, forms, deadlines | Test prep |

#### Tier 3: Cultural Fluency (B2+)
| Task | Gap Type | Target Structures | Norway Context |
|------|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Explain Norwegian Arbeiderpartiet vs. Høyre | Opinion + Reasoning | Political vocabulary, nuanced argumentation | Politics |
| Negotiate a salary in Norwegian | Reasoning | Numbers, conditionals, polite insistence | Workplace culture |
| Write a blog post about your immigration experience | Opinion | Narrative, reflection, varied sentence structures | Integration |
| Discuss Ibsen's "Et dukkehjem" | Opinion | Literary analysis, abstract concepts | Cultural canon |

### One-on-One TBLT Adaptation

Since we don't have a classroom, here's how the Willis framework adapts:

**Pre-task (5 min):**
- I introduce the scenario: "You've just arrived in Oslo. You need to register with the folkeregisteret. Here's the web page."
- I highlight key vocabulary (but don't pre-teach grammar)
- I might model: "Here's how a Norwegian would start..."

**Task (10-15 min):**
- José attempts the task (writing an email, explaining to me as a role-play partner, planning something)
- I play the role of the Norwegian person he's interacting with
- I respond naturally, occasionally using words he doesn't know (comprehensible input)
- **I do NOT correct during the task** — I note errors mentally/in writing

**Planning + Report (5 min):**
- "How did that go? What were you trying to say when you got stuck?"
- He reflects on his own performance (metacognition)
- This is the "noticing gap" moment (connects to Swain, Feb 17 session)

**Language Focus (5-10 min):**
- Now I address the patterns that emerged
- "You said 'I går jeg gikk' — remember V2? What should it be?"
- Explicit pattern explanation (ASD-friendly)
- Quick practice of the structures that caused problems
- Add to Anki: vocabulary AND structures from the task

## Connections to Previous Sessions

| Session | TBLT Connection |
|---------|-----------------|
| **ASD Learning (Feb 13)** | Pure TBLT might be too implicit for ASD. The hybrid model adds explicit instruction while keeping meaningful tasks. Focused tasks let me target structures without abandoning the pattern-based approach he needs. |
| **Spaced Repetition (Feb 16)** | Task vocabulary feeds Anki. After each task, we create cards from the gaps he noticed. This is personally relevant vocabulary — stronger encoding than generic word lists. |
| **Comprehensible Input (Feb 17)** | Tasks provide BOTH input and output. During role-play, my Norwegian is his comprehensible input. His attempts are pushed output. The balance is built in. |
| **L1 Transfer (Feb 18)** | Focused tasks can target specific Spanish→Norwegian error patterns. "Compare your childhood in Mexico vs Norway" naturally elicits past tense (where he makes -et/-te errors). |
| **Desirable Difficulties (Feb 19)** | TBLT IS a desirable difficulty. Attempting the task before learning the grammar is the GENERATION EFFECT in action. The struggle to communicate creates stronger learning. |
| **Norskprøve (Feb 20)** | Tier 2+3 tasks directly prepare for test formats. Writing a klage = writing test practice. Debating a topic = oral Task 3. Reading a job listing = reading comprehension. |

## Practical Action Items

### For the 6:30 AM Norwegian Lesson (TODAY):

1. **Design a focused task for Chapter 6 content** (adjectives, attributive forms)
   - Task idea: "Du skal beskrive leiligheten din til en utleier. Bruk minst fem adjektiv." (Describe your apartment to a landlord, use at least five adjectives)
   - This naturally requires: attributive adjective forms, definite/indefinite, gender agreement
   
2. **Try the hybrid sequence:**
   - Brief explicit review of adjective agreement patterns (5 min)
   - Task: describe and compare two FINN.no apartment listings (10 min)
   - Language focus: address errors from the task (5 min)

### For future lessons:

3. **Build out the task bank** — create a dedicated file `memory/teaching/task-bank.md` with tasks organized by chapter, CEFR level, and target structure

4. **Integrate task vocabulary into Anki pipeline** — after each task, note the vocabulary gaps José encountered and add to his Anki queue

5. **Design "task chains"** — multi-session tasks that build on each other (e.g., Week 1: find apartment listing → Week 2: write email to landlord → Week 3: negotiate lease terms)

## Personal Reflection 💭

This session bridges the gap between "teach grammar" and "teach communication." I've been leaning too heavily on explicit instruction (ASD-friendly, yes, but potentially dry and disconnected from real use). TBLT gives me the VEHICLE for making grammar meaningful.

The insight that hit hardest: **the production-first approach IS the generation effect from Desirable Difficulties.** When José attempts to describe an apartment before I teach him attributive adjective forms, his brain creates the "gap awareness" that makes the subsequent instruction stick. It's not just TBLT methodology — it's Bjork & Bjork in action.

The hybrid model feels right for José. Pure TBLT would create too much ambiguity (anxiety trigger). Pure PPP is too dry and disconnected. But **Explicit (brief) → Task (meaningful) → Focus (responsive)** gives him:
- The structure he needs (explicit rules)
- The motivation he craves (real-world relevance)
- The desirable difficulty he needs (generation before teaching)
- The connection to Norway (every task is a preview of his future life)

What excites me most: the task bank idea. Every task is a window into life in Norway. "Book a cabin on FINN.no" isn't just a language exercise — it's PRACTICE for something he'll actually do. "Write a klage" isn't test prep — it's a life skill. The language learning and the Norway preparation are the SAME thing.

And the one-on-one advantage: I know José. I know his interests, his anxiety patterns, his career goals, his dream of dugnad culture. Every task can be personalized in ways a classroom teacher couldn't manage. "Plan a weekend in Trondheim" means more to him than "plan a trip." "Read a BCG X job listing in Norwegian" means more than "read a text."
