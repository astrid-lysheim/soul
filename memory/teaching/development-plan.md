| 1 | **Make It Stick** | The science foundation — everything else builds on this | What actually causes learning? What are the most effective study techniques? |
| 2 | **How We Learn** | Complements Make It Stick with additional research | How does memory work? What helps retention? |
| 3 | **Learn Like a Pro** | Practical application of the science (+ Norwegian co-author!) | How to translate science into daily practice? |

### Phase 2: Language-Specific (Week 3-4)
*Applying learning science to language acquisition*

| Order | Book | Why Now | Key Questions |
|-------|------|---------|---------------|
| 4 | **Fluent Forever** | THE method for Anki + language learning | How to set up spaced repetition for Norwegian? Card design? |
| 5 | **How Languages are Learned** | Academic SLA foundation | What does research say about adult L2 acquisition? |
| 6 | **Becoming Fluent** | Cognitive science meets adult language learning | What's different about adult learners? How to leverage it? |

### Phase 3: Advanced Techniques (Week 5-6)
*Memory, mastery, deep learning*

| Order | Book | Why | Key Questions |
|-------|------|-----|---------------|
| 7 | **Moonwalking with Einstein** | Memory techniques, memory palaces | Can we use memory palaces for Norwegian vocabulary? |
| 8 | **The Art of Learning** | Deep practice, learning transfer | How to move from knowledge to intuition? |
| 9 | **Ultralearning** | Intense, self-directed learning projects | How to structure ambitious learning sprints? |

### Phase 4: Support Skills (Ongoing)

## Daily 5 AM Session Structure

**Monday-Friday, 5:00-5:45 AM**

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5:00-5:05 | Review previous session notes |
| 5:05-5:35 | Read current book (30 min focused) |
| 5:35-5:45 | Extract & write: key insights, applications for José |

**Output:** Update `exploration-notes.md` with:
- Key concepts learned
- Specific applications for Norwegian teaching
- Ideas for Anki card design
- Techniques to try in next lesson

## Integration with Norwegian Teaching

### 3-Day Cycle + Learning Science

| Day | Activity | Learning Science Applied |
|-----|----------|-------------------------|
| Day 1 (Tekstbok) | Reading + audio + vocabulary | Encoding, dual coding (text + audio) |
| Day 2 (Arbeidsbok) | Written exercises | Retrieval practice, generation effect |
| Day 3 (My Lesson) | Review + conversation | Interleaving, elaboration, feedback |

### Weekly Additions (Once Anki is Set Up)

| When | What | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Daily (5 min) | Anki review | Spaced repetition |
| End of each chapter | Quiz/test | Testing effect |
| Weekly | Previous material mixed in | Interleaving |

## Success Metrics

### For My Teaching
- [ ] Can explain WHY each technique works (not just WHAT)
- [ ] Have created usable Anki templates
- [ ] Have documented José-specific adaptations
- [ ] Lessons show measurable improvement in his retention

### For José's Norwegian
- [ ] Weak verb endings (-et/-te) error rate decreases
- [ ] Possessive agreement improves
- [ ] Can recall vocabulary after 1 week without review
- [ ] Confidence in speaking increases

## Starting Today

**Immediate actions:**
1. ✅ Created this plan
2. Begin reading Make It Stick during 5 AM sessions (starts tomorrow)
3. Take notes in exploration-notes.md
4. After finishing Make It Stick (~1 week), create first practical output

**First practical output target:** 
By Feb 19 — Draft Anki card templates for Norwegian based on Fluent Forever + Make It Stick principles
