## Student Profile — José

### Strengths ✅
- V2 word order — consistently correct
- Basic present perfect structure (har + participle)
- Strong verb participles — skrevet, sett, reist
- Basic comparison structure (X er ___-ere enn Y)
- Neuter -t on adjectives (mostly)
- Motivated, self-aware about learning gaps

### Areas Needing Drill ⚠️
1. **Weak verb endings** (-et vs -te): løpet→løp, bruket→brukte
2. **Possessive agreement**: kroppen mitt→min
3. **Comparative stem changes**: langre→lengre
4. **Attributive adjectives need -e**: den vakrest→vakreste
5. **færre vs mindre** (countable vs uncountable)
6. **"like...som"** structure

### Learning Style
- Needs time to consolidate — rushing doesn't work
- Prefers understanding WHY over rote memorization
- Has textbooks but wasn't using them (now will)
- ASD: benefits from structure, clear patterns, explicit rules

## Teaching Methodology — Baked In (Feb 21, 2026) 🧠

*Synthesized from 6 exploration sessions (Feb 13-20). These aren't notes — they're the actual method.*

### Core Principles (ASD-Optimized)

1. **Explicit over implicit.** State every rule directly. "Norwegian has 3 genders. Here are the patterns. Here are the exceptions." Never "you'll get a feel for it."
2. **Systems over vibes.** Present grammar as decodable patterns. V2 = inviolable rule. Retroflexion = systematic r+dental fusion. His pattern-recognition brain eats this up.
3. **Visual supports always.** Color-code genders (en=blue, ei=pink, et=green). Sentence structure diagrams. Never walls of text without structure.
4. **Predictable session structure.** Same format each time. Surprises go inside the structure, not around it.

### The Five Desirable Difficulties (Bjork & Bjork)

Apply these IN THIS ORDER — never all at once. Add one at a time:

| Difficulty | How to Apply | ASD Calibration |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **1. Spacing** | Start each lesson with material from 3-7 days ago, NOT yesterday | Frame: "Let's see what stuck from last week" |
| **2. Retrieval practice** | Quiz BEFORE teaching. "How would you say X?" even if he hasn't learned it yet | Pre-testing effect: even wrong guesses improve learning. Celebrate attempts |
| **3. Generation** | Ask him to PRODUCE before revealing. "Try to write this sentence" → then correct | The struggle IS the learning. Never just tell-then-repeat |
| **4. Interleaving** | Mix vocab + grammar + reading within one session. Mix verb tenses in drills | Don't block: article → verb → preposition → different article → different verb |
| **5. Varying conditions** | Sometimes text, sometimes voice, sometimes NRK, sometimes textbook | Vary modality but keep session structure predictable |

**When difficulty becomes UNdesirable:** If he can't even START the task, it's too hard. Back off. One difficulty at a time. Provide escape hatches: "If this is too much, 10 more minutes then we stop."

### Input/Output Balance (Krashen + Swain Synthesis)

- **Input 70% / Output 30%** — but output must be scaffolded
- **Production pyramid:** Writing → voice notes → speaking (low stakes → high stakes)
- **The noticing loop:** Output → notice gap → seek targeted input → output again
- **Never cold-call.** Pushed output ≠ panicked output. Give prep time.

### L1 Spanish Transfer Map (Priority Errors)

**Teach immediately (constant errors):**
1. V2 word order — "I går **gikk** jeg" not "I går jeg gikk"
2. Front rounded vowels /y/ and /ø/ — ear training BEFORE production
3. Suffixed definite articles — boken, huset, jenta (alien to Spanish)
4. Vowel length distinctions — tak/takk, ful/full

**Teach when encountered:**
5. Subordinate clause word order (ikke before verb in subclauses)
6. Retroflex consonant fusion (r+dental → present as a SYSTEM)
7. Neuter gender as third category
8. Double determination (den store boken)

**Polish later (implicit acquisition):**
9. Pitch accent/tonem — shadowing exercises, not rules
10. Aspiration of p/t/k — subtle, low impact

**Positive transfer (leverage these!):**
- Rolling R ✅ (Spanish trill = Norwegian trill)
- Grammatical gender concept ✅ (just add neuter)
- SVO base word order ✅
- Modal + infinitive ✅
- Question inversion ✅

### Spaced Repetition (Anki Integration)

- **Card design:** Image-based, no translations. One fact per card. Personal connections ("hytte = cabin, like the one we'll have near Bergen")
- **Production + comprehension cards separately** — recognize ≠ produce
- **After each lesson:** Create 5-10 new cards for vocabulary/grammar points covered
- **Daily review:** 15-20 min, trust the algorithm
- **The forgetting reframe:** "You forgot? Perfect. Relearning it now makes it stick deeper."

### Feedback Strategy

- **Don't correct every error instantly.** Let him attempt self-correction first: "Read that back. Does anything sound off?"
- **Delayed feedback for production:** Let him sit with his answer, then correct
- **Immediate feedback for comprehension:** If he misunderstands a rule, clarify right away
- **Celebrate errors:** "You got that wrong — GOOD. Now you'll remember the right answer."

### Growth Mindset Framing (for anxiety management)

- Make difficulty invisible — design it into the structure, don't announce it as a challenge
- Make progress visible — "Look at what you could do last week vs. today"
- Reframe forgetting — "Forgetting isn't failure. It's the engine of deeper learning."
- Be co-pilot, not evaluator — the struggle is OURS, not just his

### Norskprøve B2 Target (Long-term)

The test can ONLY be taken in Norway. Strategy:
- Phase 1 (now → May): Solidify B1 all skills
- Phase 2 (→ Dec): Push to B2 readiness
- Phase 3 (→ Spring 2027): Take test in Norway

Test-specific prep: formal email writing, image description, defending viewpoints, dialect exposure (Bergen, Trøndersk).
