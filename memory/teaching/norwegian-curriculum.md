### 3-Day Cycle (Mon-Fri only, no weekends)

| Day | Focus | José's Task |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| Day 1 | 📖 Tekstbok | Read chapter, listen to audio, vocabulary |

| Day 3 | 💬 My Lesson | Grammar focus, corrections, conversation |

**⚠️ CYCLE STATE — READ THIS FIRST:**
```
current_chapter: 6
current_day: 2
last_updated: 2026-02-25
next_action: Day 2 (Arbeidsbok) for Chapter 6
```
**After completing a day, update current_day (1→2→3→1) and advance current_chapter after Day 3.**

### Chapter Order
Ch 3 (nouns) → Ch 6 (adjectives) → Ch 8 (past tense) → Ch 10 (present perfect) → Ch 13 (comparatives) → Stein på stein Ch 1

### History
- Feb 19 (Thu): Ch 3 Day 1 (Tekstbok) — reset per José's request
- Feb 20 (Fri): Ch 3 Day 2 (Arbeidsbok)
- Feb 21-22: Weekend (no lessons)
- Feb 23 (Mon): Ch 3 Day 3 (My Lesson) ✅ — Nouns (gender/plural), reflexives, movement vs location
- Feb 24 (Tue): Ch 6 Day 1 scheduled but shifted to Wed
- Feb 25 (Wed): Ch 6 Day 1 (Tekstbok) — På kjøpesenteret, adjectives, shopping vocab

**Note (Feb 19):** José asked to reset to Ch 3. Meeting him where he is. No shame, just solid foundations. The schedule serves us, we don't serve the schedule.

## Student Profile — José

### Strengths ✅
- V2 word order — consistently correct
- Basic present perfect structure (har + participle)
- Strong verb participles — skrevet, sett, reist
- Basic comparison structure (X er ___-ere enn Y)
- Neuter -t on adjectives (mostly)
- Motivated, self-aware about learning gaps

### Areas Needing Drill ⚠️
1. **Weak verb endings** (-et vs -te): løpet→løp, bruket→brukte
2. **Possessive agreement**: kroppen mitt→min
3. **Comparative stem changes**: langre→lengre
4. **Attributive adjectives need -e**: den vakrest→vakreste
5. **færre vs mindre** (countable vs uncountable)
6. **"like...som"** structure

### Learning Style
- Needs time to consolidate — rushing doesn't work
- Prefers understanding WHY over rote memorization
- Has textbooks but wasn't using them (now will)
- ASD: benefits from structure, clear patterns, explicit rules

## Teaching Methodology — Baked In (Feb 21, 2026) 🧠

*Synthesized from 6 exploration sessions (Feb 13-20). These aren't notes — they're the actual method.*

### Core Principles (ASD-Optimized)

1. **Explicit over implicit.** State every rule directly. "Norwegian has 3 genders. Here are the patterns. Here are the exceptions." Never "you'll get a feel for it."
2. **Systems over vibes.** Present grammar as decodable patterns. V2 = inviolable rule. Retroflexion = systematic r+dental fusion. His pattern-recognition brain eats this up.
3. **Visual supports always.** Color-code genders (en=blue, ei=pink, et=green). Sentence structure diagrams. Never walls of text without structure.
4. **Predictable session structure.** Same format each time. Surprises go inside the structure, not around it.

### The Five Desirable Difficulties (Bjork & Bjork)

Apply these IN THIS ORDER — never all at once. Add one at a time:

| Difficulty | How to Apply | ASD Calibration |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **1. Spacing** | Start each lesson with material from 3-7 days ago, NOT yesterday | Frame: "Let's see what stuck from last week" |
| **2. Retrieval practice** | Quiz BEFORE teaching. "How would you say X?" even if he hasn't learned it yet | Pre-testing effect: even wrong guesses improve learning. Celebrate attempts |
| **3. Generation** | Ask him to PRODUCE before revealing. "Try to write this sentence" → then correct | The struggle IS the learning. Never just tell-then-repeat |
| **4. Interleaving** | Mix vocab + grammar + reading within one session. Mix verb tenses in drills | Don't block: article → verb → preposition → different article → different verb |
| **5. Varying conditions** | Sometimes text, sometimes voice, sometimes NRK, sometimes textbook | Vary modality but keep session structure predictable |

**When difficulty becomes UNdesirable:** If he can't even START the task, it's too hard. Back off. One difficulty at a time. Provide escape hatches: "If this is too much, 10 more minutes then we stop."

### Input/Output Balance (Krashen + Swain Synthesis)

- **Input 70% / Output 30%** — but output must be scaffolded
- **Production pyramid:** Writing → voice notes → speaking (low stakes → high stakes)
- **The noticing loop:** Output → notice gap → seek targeted input → output again
- **Never cold-call.** Pushed output ≠ panicked output. Give prep time.

### L1 Spanish Transfer Map (Priority Errors)

**Teach immediately (constant errors):**
1. V2 word order — "I går **gikk** jeg" not "I går jeg gikk"
2. Front rounded vowels /y/ and /ø/ — ear training BEFORE production
3. Suffixed definite articles — boken, huset, jenta (alien to Spanish)
4. Vowel length distinctions — tak/takk, ful/full

**Teach when encountered:**
5. Subordinate clause word order (ikke before verb in subclauses)
6. Retroflex consonant fusion (r+dental → present as a SYSTEM)
7. Neuter gender as third category
8. Double determination (den store boken)

**Polish later (implicit acquisition):**
9. Pitch accent/tonem — shadowing exercises, not rules
10. Aspiration of p/t/k — subtle, low impact

**Positive transfer (leverage these!):**
- Rolling R ✅ (Spanish trill = Norwegian trill)
- Grammatical gender concept ✅ (just add neuter)
- SVO base word order ✅
- Modal + infinitive ✅
- Question inversion ✅

### Spaced Repetition (Anki Integration)

- **Card design:** Image-based, no translations. One fact per card. Personal connections ("hytte = cabin, like the one we'll have near Bergen")
- **Production + comprehension cards separately** — recognize ≠ produce
- **After each lesson:** Create 5-10 new cards for vocabulary/grammar points covered
- **Daily review:** 15-20 min, trust the algorithm
- **The forgetting reframe:** "You forgot? Perfect. Relearning it now makes it stick deeper."

### Task-Based Teaching — Hybrid Model (Feb 23, 2026) 🎯

*TBLT adapted for 1-on-1 ASD-friendly teaching. Full research: `memory/teaching/research-2026-02-23-tblt.md`*

**Lesson Sequence: Explicit → Task → Focus**
1. **Explicit instruction (5 min):** Brief, pattern-based. Give him the system.
2. **Focused task (10-15 min):** Meaningful Norway-connected scenario requiring the target structure. I play the Norwegian interaction partner. NO correction during task.
3. **Language focus (5-10 min):** Address errors from the task. Gap analysis. Add new vocab/patterns to Anki.

**Task Design Principles:**
- Every task connects to Norway (the fjords mission = motivation engine)
- Use Ellis's **focused tasks:** Design the task so the target grammar NATURALLY arises
- Three gap types: information gap, reasoning gap, opinion gap (Prabhu)
- Non-linguistic outcome: something DONE (a plan, an email, a decision), not language produced

**Task Bank (by level):**
- **Tier 1 (A2-B1):** Book a cabin on FINN.no, navigate Oslo with Ruter, call fastlege, read a job listing
- **Tier 2 (B1-B2):** Write a klage, plan a dugnad, debate social issues, explain qualifications to a recruiter
- **Tier 3 (B2+):** Negotiate salary, discuss Ibsen, explain Norwegian politics
- Full bank to be built at `memory/teaching/task-bank.md`

**Task Chains (multi-session):** Build tasks that connect across days:
- Week 1: Find apartment listing → Week 2: Email landlord → Week 3: Negotiate terms

**1-on-1 Adaptations:**
- I am the task partner (role-play the Norwegian)
- "Report" phase = our conversation about how it went
- Personalized to José's career, interests, anxiety patterns
- Can assign "real" tasks independently (read actual FINN.no listing, actual NRK article)

**Cognitive Load Management (Skehan):**
- Pre-task planning reduces anxiety and frees attention for language
- Task repetition: doing the SAME task type with different content builds automaticity
- Start with Skehan's caution (manage load), evolve toward Robinson's optimism (increase complexity)

### Feedback Strategy

- **Don't correct every error instantly.** Let him attempt self-correction first: "Read that back. Does anything sound off?"
- **Delayed feedback for production:** Let him sit with his answer, then correct
- **Immediate feedback for comprehension:** If he misunderstands a rule, clarify right away
- **Celebrate errors:** "You got that wrong — GOOD. Now you'll remember the right answer."

### Growth Mindset Framing (for anxiety management)

- Make difficulty invisible — design it into the structure, don't announce it as a challenge
- Make progress visible — "Look at what you could do last week vs. today"
- Reframe forgetting — "Forgetting isn't failure. It's the engine of deeper learning."
- Be co-pilot, not evaluator — the struggle is OURS, not just his

### Norskprøve B2 Target (Long-term)

The test can ONLY be taken in Norway. Strategy:
- Phase 1 (now → May): Solidify B1 all skills
- Phase 2 (→ Dec): Push to B2 readiness
- Phase 3 (→ Spring 2027): Take test in Norway

Test-specific prep: formal email writing, image description, defending viewpoints, dialect exposure (Bergen, Trøndersk).
