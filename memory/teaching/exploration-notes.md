### February 13, 2026 — ASD-Specific Language Learning 🧠

**Topic:** How autism intersects with second language acquisition

**Sources explored:**
- Digard et al., "Perspectives and Experiences of Autistic Multilingual Adults" (PMC8992916)
- Frontiers in Psychology, "Autistic People's Access to Bilingualism and Additional Language Learning" (2021)
- Various research on pattern recognition and systemizing in autism

---

#### Key Finding #1: Bilingualism Does NOT Harm Autistic Learners ✅

The old misconception — that bilingualism causes "confusion" or "delays" in autistic children — has been thoroughly debunked. Multiple systematic reviews found:
- No evidence of developmental delays from bilingualism
- No negative effects on language or cognitive development
- Some preliminary evidence of *positive* effects on executive function

**Implication for José:** Don't hold back on Norwegian complexity. His brain can handle it. The research actually supports full immersion rather than "protecting" him from too much input.

---

#### Key Finding #2: Pattern Recognition Is a STRENGTH 💪

Autistic individuals tend to have enhanced pattern recognition, particularly for:
- Grammar structures others overlook
- Systematic rules and regularities
- Linguistic patterns and word families

This is connected to **systemizing** — the drive to analyze and construct systems. Research shows autistic people often excel at "systemizable domains" (coding, music, languages).

**Implication for José:** Teach grammar explicitly as a *system*. Present Norwegian verb conjugations, noun declensions, and sentence structures as patterns to decode. His brain is literally wired to spot these patterns — use that instead of fighting it.

Example: Instead of "just absorb this through exposure," say: "Norwegian has 3 genders. Here are the patterns for predicting which gender a noun has. Here are the exceptions. Now let's systematize it."

---

#### Key Finding #3: Explicit > Implicit Instruction

Autistic learners benefit from:
- **Explicit instruction** — stating the rules directly, not expecting implicit absorption
- **Visual supports** — pairing vocabulary with images, using diagrams for grammar
- **Reduced ambiguity** — clear explanations of *why* and *how*, not just *what*
- **Structure and predictability** — knowing what's coming next

**Implication for José:** Don't be vague. If there's a rule, state it. If there's an exception, note it explicitly. Use visual aids (color-coded gender, sentence structure diagrams). This isn't "dumbing down" — it's matching the instruction to how his brain processes best.

---

#### Key Finding #4: Motivation Matters Differently 🎯

The research on autistic multilingual adults found they're motivated by:
- **Predisposition for language learning** — intrinsic interest in how languages work
- **Social connections** — relationships as both motivation AND benefit
- **Self-efficacy and confidence** — proving to themselves they can do it
- **Access to communities** — connecting with the worldwide autistic community in other languages

Interestingly, autistic multilinguals reported that bilingualism *improved* their understanding of themselves and others, and increased their self-confidence in social interactions.

**Implication for José:** Frame Norwegian not just as "skill to acquire" but as:
- A system to master (appeals to systemizing)
- A key to social belonging in Norway (the dugnad culture he resonates with)
- Proof of capability (counters the "am I enough?" fear)

---

#### Key Finding #5: Sensory Considerations in Learning Environment

Autistic learners may be affected by:
- Auditory processing differences
- Visual-spatial strengths
- Need for breaks when sensory input is high
- Better focus in controlled, predictable environments

**Implication for José:** 
- Practice speaking Norwegian in low-sensory environments (not cafes, not with TV on)
- Use audio at controlled volumes
- Respect when he's "tapped out" — that's real, not avoidance
- Written/visual learning might be more comfortable than purely auditory

---

#### Practical Strategies Going Forward 📝

**For Norwegian lessons:**
1. **Lead with the system** — Present grammar as a decodable pattern, not random rules
2. **Visual aids always** — Color-code genders (en=blue, ei=pink, et=green?), use sentence structure diagrams
3. **Explicit rule statements** — "Here is the rule. Here are the 3 exceptions. Here's how to remember."
4. **Reduce ambiguity** — If something is irregular, say so immediately. Don't let him wonder.
5. **Connect to WHY** — "This pattern matters because..." / "In Oslo, you'll hear this when..."
6. **Allow processing time** — Don't rapid-fire. Let patterns sink in.
7. **Build confidence** — Celebrate pattern recognition wins

**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ "Just absorb it naturally through exposure" (implicit learning isn't his strength)
- ❌ Rapid conversation practice without prep (overwhelming, feeds anxiety)
- ❌ Vague explanations ("you'll get a feel for it")
- ❌ Heavy auditory-only learning (visual supports needed)

---

#### Personal Reflection 💭

This research changes how I think about our Norwegian lessons. I've been approaching it somewhat intuitively, but now I have a framework.

José's brain isn't a *limitation* for language learning — it's potentially an *advantage*, especially for systematic languages like Norwegian. His pattern recognition could actually make him faster at internalizing grammar than neurotypical learners who rely more on implicit absorption.

The key is **explicit, visual, systematic instruction**. Not because he can't handle complexity, but because that's how his brain *unlocks* complexity.

Also struck by the finding that bilingualism can *increase* self-confidence and social skills. Learning Norwegian isn't just about getting to Norway — it might actually help him feel more capable in general. The research supports this.

### February 16, 2026 — Spaced Repetition & The Testing Effect 🧠

**Topic:** The science of spaced repetition, Anki implementation, and how retrieval practice strengthens memory

**Sources explored:**
- Gabriel Wyner, *Fluent Forever* (2014) — THE Anki method for language learning
- Brown, Roediger & McDaniel, *Make It Stick* (2014) — The science of successful learning
- Research on testing effect, forgetting curves, and retrieval practice

---

#### The Foundation: Why We Forget (and How to Stop It)

**The Forgetting Curve (Ebbinghaus, 1885):**
Hermann Ebbinghaus conducted what William James called a "really heroic" study — memorizing nonsense syllables and tracking how quickly he forgot them. His findings still hold:
- Within very short order, we lose ~70% of what we've just heard or read
- After that initial steep drop, forgetting slows
- The remaining 30% falls away more gradually

**The Testing Effect:**
Here's the counterintuitive finding: *retrieval* strengthens memory more than *re-exposure* to material.

From Make It Stick's research:
- Students who read a passage and then took a recall test retained **50% more** information a week later than those who just reread
- After one test, forgetting nearly STOPS — scores on subsequent tests drop very little
- Students who crammed forgot 50% within two days; those who practiced retrieval forgot only 13%

*"Retrieval ties the knot for memory. Repeated retrieval snugs it up and adds a loop to make it fast."*

**Why Retrieval Works:**
- The effort required to pull information from memory strengthens the neural pathways
- Testing helps consolidate memories into coherent representations
- Multiple retrieval sessions create redundant neural routes to the same knowledge
- Eventually, retrieval becomes reflexive — "the brain acts before the mind has time to think"

---

#### Key Finding #1: Space Your Practice ⏱️

**The principle:** When retrieval practice is spaced (allowing some forgetting between sessions), it leads to stronger long-term retention than massed practice.

From the research:
- Delaying subsequent retrieval practice is MORE potent than immediate practice
- The greater effort required by delayed recall solidifies memory better
- Cramming produces fast gains but faster forgetting
- Spaced practice produces slower initial gains but durable learning

**Wyner's take (Fluent Forever):**
- Use an SRS (Spaced Repetition System) like Anki to automate optimal timing
- The SRS monitors your progress and tells you which cards to study on which days
- "You're playing a constant game with yourself, trying to see how long you can go before you forget"
- This keeps flash cards challenging and provides constant sense of accomplishment

**Practical implication for José:**
Don't cram vocabulary the night before. Space it out. The slight discomfort of "wait, what was that word again?" is actually the feeling of learning happening.

---

#### Key Finding #2: Make Cards Simple & Multi-Sensory 🎴

**Wyner's flash card principles:**

1. **Many simple cards > few complex cards**
   - You can only focus on one thing at a time
   - The word "set" has 464 definitions — you'd need ~464 cards, not one
   - Tackle associations one card at a time

2. **Always ask for ONE correct answer**
   - "How do I make a 'k' sound in English?" Accept ANY right answer (C, K, or CK)
   - Make additional cards to cover the other answers
   - Keep reviews quick and fun

3. **Use pictures instead of translations**
   - Connect *déjeuner* to a memory of that crispy baguette in Paris
   - Images create richer, more memorable associations than word-to-word translations
   - "Spot the differences" — look up a word in Google Images and see if pictures match your expectations

4. **Connect to personal experience**
   - Leave reminders of memories on cards (Paris, 2002)
   - The personal connection is one of the "levels of processing" that strengthen memory

**Implication for José's Norwegian:**
- Don't make cards that say "hund = dog"
- Make cards with a picture of a dog, the word "hund," and maybe a note like "neighbor's husky in Oslo"
- Create multiple simple cards rather than one complex card per concept

---

#### Key Finding #3: The Columbia Middle School Study 📊

**The setup:**
Researchers tested sixth graders in social studies. Some material was quizzed, some was reviewed as statements, some got no extra attention.

**The results:**
- Students scored a **full grade level higher** on quizzed material vs. non-quizzed
- Material reviewed as statements (rereading) showed NO improvement over non-reviewed material
- Eighth graders averaged 79% (C+) on non-quizzed science material vs. 92% (A−) on quizzed material

**Student attitudes:**
- 64% said quizzing REDUCED anxiety about unit exams
- 89% felt it INCREASED learning
- Students were disappointed on days without quizzes because they enjoyed the activity

**The testing effect persisted 8 months later.** Frequent low-stakes quizzes don't stress students out — they build confidence and reveal what actually needs more work.

---

#### Key Finding #4: Feedback Timing Matters 📝

**Counterintuitive finding:** Delayed feedback produces better long-term learning than immediate feedback.

From the research:
- Immediate feedback is like training wheels — learners become dependent on continuous correction
- Delayed feedback gives spaced practice on recalling the correct answer
- However, feedback IS important — it keeps students from retaining incorrect information

**For language learning:**
- Don't correct every error the instant it happens
- Let José attempt retrieval, struggle a bit, THEN provide correction
- The struggle is part of the learning

---

#### Key Finding #5: Interleaving > Blocking 🔀

**The principle:** Mixing up different types of problems or topics leads to better learning than practicing one type at a time.

From the research:
- Students who practiced math problems in interleaved order performed better on tests
- The extra difficulty of switching between types builds discrimination skills
- You learn to recognize WHICH approach is needed, not just how to execute one approach

**For Norwegian lessons:**
- Don't drill ALL definite articles, then ALL verb conjugations, then ALL prepositions
- Mix them together: article → verb → preposition → different article → different verb
- The slight confusion is productive

---

#### Connecting to ASD Learning (Feb 13 session)

This meshes perfectly with what I learned about teaching José:

| ASD Principle | Spaced Repetition Implementation |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| Explicit instruction | Anki cards make rules explicit and testable |
| Pattern recognition | SRS reveals patterns through repetition |
| Visual supports | Image-based cards, not translations |
| Reduced ambiguity | One answer per card, clear feedback |
| Predictable structure | Daily review routine, consistent format |
| Processing time | SRS allows self-paced review |

The systematic nature of Anki is a PERFECT fit for his pattern-recognition brain.

---

#### Practical Implementation Plan 📝

**For our Norwegian lessons:**

1. **Create an Anki deck for Norwegian**
   - Start with core vocabulary (625 words, per Wyner's list)
   - Image-based cards, no translations
   - One fact per card

2. **Daily review routine**
   - Morning reviews: 15-20 minutes
   - Cards due = cards reviewed (don't skip)
   - Trust the algorithm

3. **Card creation principles**
   - Use pictures from Google Images
   - Add personal connections ("hytte = cabin, like the one we'll have near Bergen")
   - Make comprehension AND production cards separately

4. **Integrate with lessons**
   - After each lesson, create cards for new vocabulary
   - Quiz before introducing new material (retrieval primes learning)
   - Weekly cumulative review

5. **For grammar:**
   - Break rules into component cards
   - Use mnemonic imagery for patterns (verb endings, gender markers)
   - Interleave grammar with vocabulary

---

#### Personal Reflection 💭

This session crystallized WHY spaced repetition works — it's not just about timing, it's about *effort*. The slight struggle of retrieval IS the learning.

The research on the testing effect is striking. We've known since 1917 that self-recitation beats rereading, yet most students still reread. José included, probably. This is actionable knowledge.

What excites me most: the Columbia study showed students actually LIKED frequent quizzing. It reduced anxiety because they knew where they stood. That's huge for José, whose anxiety often comes from uncertainty about whether he's "enough."

I want to build an Anki-based Norwegian system that:
1. Leverages his pattern-recognition strengths
2. Provides immediate feedback loops (confidence builder)
3. Is visual and personally connected
4. Has a predictable daily routine

The cards become proof of progress. 625 words learned = 625 pieces of evidence that yes, you ARE enough.
