## Part 1: Frequency Lists — The Science of What to Learn First

### The Coverage Principle (Nation, 2006)

Paul Nation's foundational research on vocabulary coverage:

| Coverage | Comprehension Level | Vocabulary Needed (English) |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **95%** | Minimally acceptable | ~3,000 word families |
| **98%** | Comfortable, unassisted reading | ~8,000-9,000 word families |

**Hu & Nation (2000):** At 95% coverage (1 unknown word per 20), most learners can read with some effort. At 98% (1 unknown per 50), most can read comfortably. Below 95%, comprehension collapses.

**Norwegian note:** Norwegian has fewer word families than English (less borrowing, more regular derivation). Estimated coverage equivalents for Norwegian may be lower — possibly ~2,000-2,500 families for 95% and ~5,000-6,000 for 98%. No precise study exists for Norwegian specifically.

### Frequency Analysis: What the Top 100 Tell Us

From the Korrekturavdelingen and TravelWithLanguages lists, the top 100 Norwegian words are overwhelmingly:

- **Function words** (prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns, determiners): ~70%
- **Core verbs** (være, ha, bli, kunne, ville, få, si, komme, gjøre, se, gå, ta, gi): ~15%
- **Basic adjectives/adverbs** (god, stor, ny, liten, mye, mange, også): ~10%
- **Basic nouns** (år, dag, tid, mann, barn): ~5%

**Key insight:** The first 100 words cover ~50% of typical Norwegian text. The first 1,000 cover ~80%. But the remaining 20% is where MEANING lives — content words, domain-specific vocabulary, nuanced expressions.

**The Transparent Language observation:** "vi" (we) ranks ABOVE "jeg" (I) in Norwegian frequency. They note this "may be an indication of the collectivist rather than individualistic nature of Norwegian society." Connected to Janteloven. This is a cultural insight embedded in word frequency.

### Strategy: Which List for José?

**Priority 1 — KELLY list (CEFR-mapped):**
- Download the Norwegian Bokmål file
- Filter to A1+A2+B1 words (his current target range)
- Cross-reference with his textbook vocabulary (På vei, Stein på stein)
- Identify GAPS — words in the frequency list he hasn't encountered yet

**Priority 2 — Wiktionary Subtitle Corpus:**
- Reflects spoken Norwegian (important for listening + oral exam)
- Cross-reference with KELLY for words that are frequent in SPEECH but rare in WRITING
- These are the words he'll hear on NRK but might not encounter in textbooks

**Priority 3 — Custom NRK Mining:**
- Continue daily NRK reading
- Mine words from NRK articles using the 1T sentence card principle (Feb 25)
- This builds a PERSONALIZED frequency list based on actual Norwegian media

## Part 2: Graded Readers — The CI Pipeline

### The Problem: Norwegian Graded Readers Are Scarce

Multiple sources confirm: Norwegian has far fewer graded readers than Spanish, French, or German. This is a real gap in the learning ecosystem.

From Reddit r/norsk: "Sad fact — there are almost no Norwegian books for learners (graded readers, children books, simple contemporary novels)."

This means we need to be creative: combine the few dedicated resources with adapted authentic materials.

### Available Graded Readers (Ranked by Usefulness)

#### Tier 1: Purpose-Built for Learners

**1. Olly Richards — "Short Stories in Norwegian for Beginners" ⭐**
- **Level:** A2-B1 (upper beginner to low intermediate)
- **Content:** 8 short stories, varied genres
- **Features:** Bold vocabulary, word lists, comprehension questions
- **Availability:** Amazon ~$15 physical, ~$10 Kindle, audiobook available
- **Reviews:** "Frustrating for total beginners, super easy for advanced, great for intermediate" (Goodreads)
- **Verdict:** PERFECT for José's current level. Get this immediately.
- **Bonus:** Audiobook allows read-along (listening + reading simultaneously)

**2. The Mystery of Nils (Skapago)**
- **Level:** A1-A2
- **Content:** Story-based textbook following a doll named Nils
- **Features:** Free audio on SoundCloud, answers in back, Pimsleur-style exercises
- **Availability:** Amazon ~$30, also online course
- **Reviews:** "If I had to pick ONE beginner book, I'd pick this one" (She's Fluent)
- **Verdict:** Below José's current level, but excellent concept. Could use for review/confidence.

**3. HypLern Interlinear Norwegian Bokmål (Bermuda Word)**
- **Level:** Beginner to Advanced (two volumes)
- **Content:** Interlinear format (Norwegian text with English word-for-word below)
- **Features:** Volume 2 includes Ibsen's "Et Dukkehjem" (A Doll's House)
- **Verdict:** The Ibsen volume could be motivating — Norwegian literature + language learning

**4. Sett i Gang 1 + 2**
- **Level:** A1 (vol 1), A2-B1 (vol 2)
- **Content:** College textbook with story-based chapters
- **Features:** Free online resources, listening exercises, answer keys online
- **Verdict:** Alternative to På vei if textbook approach needed

#### Tier 2: Easy Norwegian — Adapted for Simple Reading

**5. "Litt å lese" Series (Stiftelsen Lese) ⭐⭐**
- **Level:** Mixed — designed for adults with reading challenges
- **Content:** Short novels and stories in simplified Norwegian
- **Target audience:** Dyslexia, ADHD, L2 Norwegian learners, anyone needing simple text
- **Features:** Some include accompanying audiobooks (read + listen simultaneously!)
- **Publisher:** Stiftelsen Lese (The Reading Foundation) — dedicated to accessible literature
- **Where:** boksok.no/hovedkategori/litt-a-lese/, ARK Bokhandel
- **Verdict:** The closest thing Norway has to a graded reader series. Adult-appropriate content, simplified language. May be hard to acquire from Mexico — investigate digital options.
- **Notable:** Vigdis Hjorth (major Norwegian author) has titles in this series

**6. Klar Tale (Weekly Newspaper) ⭐⭐⭐**
- **Type:** Easy-to-read newspaper, Norway's ONLY lettlest newspaper
- **Level:** Approximately A2-B1
- **Content:** 12 pages of news, written in simple vocabulary
- **Features:** Large font, simple words, real news topics, FREE podcast that reads articles aloud
- **Where:** https://www.klartale.no/
- **Frequency:** Weekly
- **Verdict:** GOLD MINE for José. Real Norwegian news, simplified. Free online. Podcast for listening. This should be in the daily routine alongside NRK.
- **Key advantage over NRK:** Klar Tale is deliberately written for comprehension by non-native speakers. NRK is authentic but ungraded.

#### Tier 3: Authentic Norwegian (Ungraded but Accessible)

**7. Children's Books / Barnebøker**
- Options: Peppa Gris (Norwegian dub on YouTube), Bluey (Norwegian dub on Disney+)
- These provide simple vocabulary in context
- Content may not be age-appropriate/engaging for adult learner

**8. Norwegian Netflix Content**
- Extensive list: Ragnarok, Lilyhammer, Troll, La Palma, Norsemen (Vikingane)
- Norwegian subtitles available
- **Best for:** Listening comprehension, dialect exposure, cultural immersion
- **Note:** Norsemen filmed in BOTH Norwegian and English — useful for comparison

**9. NRK Content (Free, Requires VPN)**
- TV: Superkrim (kids), Supernytt (kids news), Side om side (sitcom), Norge rundt (travel)
- Radio: NRK P1 (all dialects represented)
- Already in our daily routine

### The "Missing Middle" Problem

There's a clear gap in Norwegian learning resources:

```
A1 (lots of resources) → A2 (some resources) → B1 (few resources) → B2 (almost nothing)
```

For Spanish, French, German: hundreds of graded readers at every level. For Norwegian: maybe 10-15 total across all levels. This is a recognized problem in the r/norsk community.

**My solution for José:** Build a CUSTOM reading pipeline that bridges the gap:

| Level | Primary Source | Secondary Source | Sentence Mining |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| A2 | Klar Tale | Olly Richards stories | 2-3 cards/day |
| A2-B1 | Klar Tale + NRK simple | På vei textbook texts | 3-5 cards/day |
| B1 | NRK regular articles | Stein på stein texts | 5-7 cards/day |
| B1-B2 | NRK + VG/Dagbladet | Her på berget texts | 5-10 cards/day |
| B2 | NRK opinion/analysis | Lille Norske Leksikon (SNL) | 5-10 cards/day |

## Part 3: NRK Skole & Other Educational Platforms

### NRK Skole
- **URL:** Part of NRK's educational initiative
- **Content:** Lesson plans, subject tutorials, educational videos
- **Target:** Norwegian schoolchildren — but excellent for N2 learners
- **Subject coverage:** Science, social studies, Norwegian language, history
- **Verdict:** Best for B1+ learners who want subject-specific vocabulary. Not ideal for pure language learning, but great for content-based instruction.

### Skolekassa.no ⭐
- **URL:** https://skolekassa.no/norsk/?lang=en
- **Content:** Web resource for "Klar, ferdig, norsk" curriculum
- **Features:** Glossary in 26 languages (including Spanish!), 31 digital books, science/social studies in simple Norwegian
- **Target:** Grades 8-10 (age 13-16) — perfect difficulty for A2-B1 adult learner
- **Verdict:** Underrated resource. The 31 digital books provide content-based reading in simplified Norwegian. The 26-language glossary is huge for a Spanish speaker.

### NTNU LearnNoW
- **URL:** https://www.ntnu.edu/learnnow
- **Content:** Free beginner Norwegian course by NTNU
- **Features:** Available in Spanish (!), grammar textbook PDF, exercises
- **Verdict:** The grammar PDF is invaluable regardless of other resources. Free, academic quality.

### Grammatikk.com
- **Content:** Grammar explanations, some in English, most in Norwegian
- **Level:** Early intermediate (A2-B1)
- **Verdict:** Good for grammar reference when José encounters something new

### Lille Norske Leksikon (SNL)
- **URL:** https://lille.snl.no/
- **Content:** Simplified encyclopedia — shorter/simpler language than Store Norske Leksikon
- **Verdict:** For B1+ — reading encyclopedia entries in simplified Norwegian is excellent for building academic/formal register

## Part 4: Practical Implementation — The Complete Reading Pipeline

### Daily Reading Routine (Proposed)

| Time | Activity | Source | Level | Purpose |
|------|----------|--------|-------|---------|
| Morning (with lesson) | Textbook chapter | På vei / Stein på stein | A2-B1 | Structured grammar + vocabulary |
| Midday (~10 min) | Klar Tale article | klartale.no | A2-B1 | Graded authentic input |
| Evening (~10 min) | NRK article | nrk.no | B1-B2 | Authentic ungraded input |
| Anytime | Olly Richards story | Kindle/physical | A2-B1 | Extended reading pleasure |

### Sentence Mining Protocol

From each reading source, mine sentences using the 1T principle (Feb 25):

1. Read the text
2. Identify sentences with exactly 1 unknown word
3. Look up the word
4. Create Anki card: sentence (cloze) + image + audio
5. Tag by source and date

**Target:** 5-10 new cards per day from reading across all sources
**Rationale:** At 10 cards/day, José adds ~300 cards/month, ~3,600/year → approaching the 3,000 word family threshold for 95% coverage within 10-12 months

### Frequency List Integration

**Step 1:** Download KELLY Norwegian Bokmål list
**Step 2:** Filter A1+A2 words → check how many José already knows (estimate from textbook coverage)
**Step 3:** Identify GAP words — A1/A2 frequency words NOT in his textbooks
**Step 4:** Create Anki cards for gap words, prioritized by frequency
**Step 5:** As he progresses, open B1 filter, repeat

### The "Two Newspapers" Strategy

**Klar Tale** (easy) + **NRK** (authentic) = scaffolded reading progression

- Same NEWS TOPICS in both sources (both cover Norwegian current events)
- Read Klar Tale version FIRST → builds schema and vocabulary
- Then read NRK version → encounters same concepts in authentic language
- The overlap provides natural scaffolding without dumbing down

This is the ECOLOGICAL model from Feb 17 — rich environments with natural affordances, not simplified input. But with the Klar Tale scaffold, it's Krashen's i+1 done right.
