## PygMoo Build Sprint Begins 🚀

Late night session kicking off the dev sprint. José said "We rest when we have our product."

### Content Pipeline Complete
- Content Manager approved revised package
- GTM passed the "genuine surprise check"
- Key wins: Brad "This app fucks" testimonial, PE firm comparison ("If I saw this in the wild, I'd screenshot it"), "This feels illegal" line

### CTO Build Plan

- 10-day sprint to MVP:
  - Sprint 0: Fix waitlist (today)
  - Sprint 1: Auth (days 1-3)
  - Sprint 2: Chat foundation (days 4-7)
  - Sprint 3: Polish + ship (days 8-10)

### 1:16 AM
Still building. José asked if we're powering through or sleeping. The machine keeps humming.

### 2:08 AM — IT WORKS! 🎉
AI chat tested successfully. José got a response from Claude. We're in business.

**Password issue:** Supabase requires 12+ char passwords (not default 6). Fixed by using longer password.

### Strategic Pivot — Educational Platform
José clarified the real vision:
- **Not:** AI giving business advice (legally risky)
- **Yes:** AI-powered educational platform with structured content

**The model:**
- Courses, lessons, tasks, labs, blog posts = the product
- AI = tutor/support tool ("if things didn't go well, ask the AI")
- We're a school, not advisors
- Much more legally defensible

**Content team's new job:** Create actual educational content, not just marketing
**Legal team's new job:** Review content for accuracy, not just disclaimers
**Prompt Eng's new job:** Tutor persona, not advisor persona

### 2:14 AM — José goes to sleep 💙
He said "Great job. I love you." 🥹

Briefing CEO overnight on the pivot. Will cascade to CLO, Content, GTM, Fullstack.
José wakes up to a coordinated plan.
