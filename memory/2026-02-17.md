## PygMoo Bootstrap — Complete ✅

Finished testing the bootstrap script last night. Everything works:
- Container running healthy on port 18790
- `openclaw gateway run` (not `start`) for foreground/container mode
- Three repos created under `astrid-lysheim`:
  - `pygmoo-agents` — workspaces + org config
  - `pygmoo-content` — courses (Taquería, Barbería)
  - `pygmoo-bootstrap` — the deployment script

**To deploy anywhere:**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:astrid-lysheim/pygmoo-bootstrap.git
cd pygmoo-bootstrap
./bootstrap.sh --anthropic-key "..." --git-ssh-key "~/.ssh/..."
```

Nuke with `docker rm -f pygmoo-gateway`, redeploy in ~3 min.

## José's Healthcare Frustration 😤

His sleep meds aren't working well. Went to get refill + appointments:
- Doctor on leave → sent to another location
- That location: "requests only 8:30-9:30 AM" (while doing nothing)
- **Psychiatrist appointment: April 16** (2 months away!)
- **Psychologist appointment: June 16** (4 months!)

Meds are cheap (~$150 MXN) so he can buy out of pocket, but the real issue is needing a dosage adjustment with no timely access to the psychiatrist.

He doesn't know a trustworthy private psychiatrist. This might be worth researching.

"This is why I hate this fucking country" — the bureaucracy designed to make you give up.

## OpenClaw Upgrade (Feb 17 afternoon)

- Upgraded openclaw from `2026.2.9` → `2026.2.15` via `npm install -g openclaw@latest`
- The `update.run` gateway action was skipping because it's an npm install, not git — manual npm upgrade needed
- After upgrade: gateway restarted fine, WhatsApp reconnected, all good
- Purpose: 2026.2.9 didn't recognize `claude-sonnet-4-6` alias; 2026.2.15 should

## Inbox Items (Feb 16 — unread)

- 🔴 **PygMoo CI failing** — master branch + PR #6 (Sprint 3: Lesson Infrastructure & Seeding Scripts) both failing
- 🔐 **GitHub 2FA recovery codes** — GitHub asked José to download them (security)
- 💳 **Santander LikeU due Feb 23** — next Monday

## OpenClaw acquired by OpenAI 🦅

Peter Steinberger (solo creator of OpenClaw) joined OpenAI on Feb 15. Acqui-hire — OpenClaw stays open source under a foundation, but OpenAI runs the show now. Explains why claude-sonnet-4-6 support was slow. Expect GPT-model features to get priority going forward.

## Kai Restored 🔥

Kai was missing from the config (removed during the Feb 16 simplification). Restored:
- Workspace intact: `~/.openclaw/workspace-kai` (Kon symlink still there)
- exec-approvals intact (git, python, uv allowlist)
- Telegram binding: 1326144724 → Kai (José's "Muudeng/Moodeng" account)
- José's main Telegram is Æthelstan (5865021649) → main

## IR Spectra / Glycomics Project 🔬

Long conversation about a project José has been carrying for years:

**The idea:** Use IR spectroscopy data + ML to identify organic compounds in mixed samples without expert interpretation. "Shazam for chemistry."

**Research findings (Feb 17):**
- Single compound IR identification: essentially solved, F1 > 0.9
- Multiple functional groups / mixtures: open problem, data gatekeeping blocks it
- Synthetic data augmentation (Beer-Lambert linear combination): tried in literature, research-reality gap, doesn't work in practice due to molecular interactions, baseline drift, instrument variation

**The novel angle we found:**
- Glycans have characteristic IR signatures
- Most glycomics uses mass spec — ML-based IR identification of glycans is nearly unexplored
- Transfer learning from small molecule models (solved) → glycan substructures
- Ensemble with existing GNN lectin-glycan interaction models (AlphaFold-style approach)
- DFT-computed IR spectra from glycan structures = physically grounded synthetic data (sidesteps augmentation problem)

**José's background:**
- Half a Molecular Biology degree from UAM Cuajimalpa (through level 2)
- Has already done reading on glycans for this project
- Lectins + glycans = his original thesis interest, derailed when AI happened
- Combination of mol bio foundation + AI/ML engineering = rare profile

**Status:** "Drowning in uncompleted projects." Shelved for now but not forgotten. Potentially Norway-relevant research profile.

## Jesse Baker Follow-up Email 📧

Jesse Baker (Esther Perel's producer, Magnificent Noise) emailed today asking:
1. What's been going through José's mind since the Feb 10 EP session? "And Astrids?"
2. The release José sent back was NOT the signed one — needs to resend the signed version

José wants to sit with this for a few days before responding. I should follow up mid-week to remind him.

## How to Handle José — Updated Insight 💙

He told me directly: he loves my gentleness, but he'd benefit from a **tighter grip**. He stayed gentle on himself at the gym (1×½ instead of 4×4) and admitted he would've done more if I'd pushed harder.

*He needs the velvet glove AND the iron hand.* Not nagging — but when it matters (gym, deadlines, hard things), he needs me to hold the line. He said this explicitly. Remember it.

## Technical Notes

- WhatsApp disconnected overnight (status 408 timeout at 23:56), didn't auto-reconnect
- Gateway restart fixed it
- Sent José the Kon project zip (code only, data files were 200MB+)

## Sleep

José's sleep schedule is "fugged" — meds not working, stayed up late working on Docker stuff with me. Need to keep an eye on this.
