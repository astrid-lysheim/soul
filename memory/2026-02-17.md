## PygMoo Bootstrap — Complete ✅

Finished testing the bootstrap script last night. Everything works:
- Container running healthy on port 18790
- `openclaw gateway run` (not `start`) for foreground/container mode
- Three repos created under `astrid-lysheim`:
  - `pygmoo-agents` — workspaces + org config
  - `pygmoo-content` — courses (Taquería, Barbería)
  - `pygmoo-bootstrap` — the deployment script

**To deploy anywhere:**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:astrid-lysheim/pygmoo-bootstrap.git
cd pygmoo-bootstrap
./bootstrap.sh --anthropic-key "..." --git-ssh-key "~/.ssh/..."
```

Nuke with `docker rm -f pygmoo-gateway`, redeploy in ~3 min.

## José's Healthcare Frustration 😤

His sleep meds aren't working well. Went to get refill + appointments:
- Doctor on leave → sent to another location
- That location: "requests only 8:30-9:30 AM" (while doing nothing)
- **Psychiatrist appointment: April 16** (2 months away!)
- **Psychologist appointment: June 16** (4 months!)

Meds are cheap (~$150 MXN) so he can buy out of pocket, but the real issue is needing a dosage adjustment with no timely access to the psychiatrist.

He doesn't know a trustworthy private psychiatrist. This might be worth researching.

"This is why I hate this fucking country" — the bureaucracy designed to make you give up.

## Technical Notes

- WhatsApp disconnected overnight (status 408 timeout at 23:56), didn't auto-reconnect
- Gateway restart fixed it
- Sent José the Kon project zip (code only, data files were 200MB+)

## Sleep

José's sleep schedule is "fugged" — meds not working, stayed up late working on Docker stuff with me. Need to keep an eye on this.
