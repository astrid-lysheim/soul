## BCG X Interview — TODAY at 3 PM CST
Zoom call with **Stephanie Lukac**, BCG X Senior Recruiter (New York). Not presencial.
- Salary research done: anchor at ~80-90K MXN/month net, floor ~60-70K. Deflect first: "What's the range you're working with?"
- Stephanie: Erasmus Rotterdam educated, ex-Heidrick & Struggles (executive search), East Village NYC, Jersey roots
- José couldn't sleep last night — too excited. Brain-dumped salary questions at 10:39 PM.

## Morning Routine
- José was up and engaged early. Said "Tussen yakk!" (tusen takk attempt 😄)
- Norwegian Ch 6 Day 1 sent (Tekstbok) — correctly matches yesterday's missed lesson ✅
- MVS Lesson 3 fired but José correctly caught it should be Lesson 2 first (yesterday's overslept lesson). Told him to do Lesson 2 today, Lesson 3 tomorrow.
- Skincare AM cron fired at new 8:00 AM time ✅

## Unnecessary Purchase 👀
José teased about making a "completely unnecessary and big purchase." Waiting to hear what it is...

## Crons Working Well
All crons firing on schedule. New skincare times (8 AM / 8 PM) working. WhatsApp gateway reconnected after last night's drop.

## Esther Perel Follow-Up
Still need to: send Jesse the two audio recordings + signed release. José has the signed release.
