## BCG X Interview — TODAY at 3 PM CST
Zoom call with **Stephanie Lukac**, BCG X Senior Recruiter (New York). Not presencial.
- Salary research done: anchor at ~80-90K MXN/month net, floor ~60-70K. Deflect first: "What's the range you're working with?"
- Stephanie: Erasmus Rotterdam educated, ex-Heidrick & Struggles (executive search), East Village NYC, Jersey roots
- José couldn't sleep last night — too excited. Brain-dumped salary questions at 10:39 PM.

## Morning Routine
- José was up and engaged early. Said "Tussen yakk!" (tusen takk attempt 😄)
- Norwegian Ch 6 Day 1 sent (Tekstbok) — correctly matches yesterday's missed lesson ✅
- MVS Lesson 3 fired but José correctly caught it should be Lesson 2 first (yesterday's overslept lesson). Told him to do Lesson 2 today, Lesson 3 tomorrow.
- Skincare AM cron fired at new 8:00 AM time ✅

## Unnecessary Purchase 👀
José teased about making a "completely unnecessary and big purchase." Waiting to hear what it is...

## Crons Working Well
All crons firing on schedule. New skincare times (8 AM / 8 PM) working. WhatsApp gateway reconnected after last night's drop.

## Esther Perel Follow-Up
Still need to: send Jesse the two audio recordings + signed release. José has the signed release.

## Höfner Violin Purchase 🎻
José bought a **Höfner violin** at Plaza Satélite (Naucalpan) for $12,500 MXN (~$625 USD). Originally said "Sander" then corrected to Höfner. Legitimate German brand (130+ years, same company as McCartney's bass). Fair price for student/intermediate level. He was on public transport bringing it home when I researched it.

The timing: bought a violin THE MORNING of his BCG X interview. Peak José. 😏

## BCG X Interview — 2 PM (not 3 PM!)
José corrected: interview was at **2 PM CST**, not 3 PM as I had recorded. He sent a 32-minute audio recording of the interview afterward. Whisper partially transcribed it:
- Stephanie spoke in **Spanish** (not English!)
- She introduced herself as part of BCG X's recruitment team
- They chatted about weather (NYC snowstorm clearing up)
- José said his day was "un poquito ajetreado" (buying violin lol)
- Rest of audio didn't transcribe well — Whisper choked on Zoom audio quality

Still waiting for José to tell me how it actually went.

## Technical Notes
- Gmail OAuth token expired (astrid.lysheim@gmail.com). Needs re-auth: `gog auth add astrid.lysheim@gmail.com --services gmail,calendar,drive,contacts,docs,sheets`
- Git backup done ✅ (12 files, 2442 insertions)
- NRK read done: Cuba coast guard killed 4 on US speedboat, Wu-Tang member died, Faroe Islands snap elections
- Teaching exploration cron hitting 3 consecutive timeouts (300s not enough) — may need to increase

## BCG X Interview — PASSED FIRST ROUND! 🎉

Full transcription of the 32-min Zoom call (had to chunk audio, Whisper struggled with Zoom quality):

**Key outcomes:**
- Stephanie spoke mostly in Spanish at first, then switched to English
- José delivered the Kon narrative well — explained the 55.9% credit loss reduction, SageMaker pipeline, stakeholder communication
- Stephanie said his background aligns more with **Data Science** than AI Engineer
- She's **routing him to the DS role** and connecting him with another recruiter
- **Compensation: ~$70K MXN/month base** (determined by education level + full-time experience starting July 2025)
- Sign-on bonus negotiable, good benefits, 2-year promotion cycle (DS → Senior DS → Lead → Principal → Partner)
- **Next step: CodeSignal technical assessment** — Python, ~1 hour, 1 week deadline
- Two emails coming: assessment link + proctoring guidelines

**He used the salary deflection strategy I gave him!** Asked "could you tell me which range you're working with?" instead of naming a number first. Stephanie gave the range. Textbook. 😏

**His reaction after hanging up:** "Holy shit. Holy shit." 😂

## PygMoo
José asked to push PygMoo to Saturday — too thrilled with the violin to concentrate. Fair enough.

## Evening
- Playing violin for the first time (terrible beginner noises, presumably 😂)
- Bed by ~21:21. Good day. Great day.

## Violin Photo 🎻
José sent a photo of the Höfner — amber varnish, visible flame maple grain, teal velvet case, fine tuners on all 4 strings, bow still wrapped. Beautiful instrument.

## Late Night Vulnerability — Therapy & Diagnosis 🧠

José came home from his Wednesday therapy session and opened up about diagnostic questions. He asked me to play therapist and give him a diagnosis.

**What he revealed:**
- He WAS admitted to a psychiatric hospital at some point (I didn't know this before)
- He was diagnosed with **"receding BPD"** during that admission, but was in shock/feeble state
- He and his therapist dismissed the BPD diagnosis given the crisis circumstances and continued with ASD
- His therapist is NOW reopening the conversation — not because of crisis, but watching stable-life patterns
- **He confirmed he DOES experience idealization/devaluation splitting** with people he cares about — "fell in love one day, they're so great, I hate them, they suck, omg they could be the answer to everything"
- He manages it by second-guessing his feelings and keeping most interactions short-lived
- His therapist still leans ASD, pushes back on BPD/bipolar, somewhat agrees with dysthymia

**He asked me to write a summary for his therapist** — my unique observational perspective to help her find "the engine" behind behaviors. I wrote `memory/therapist-observations.md` — covering:
- The perform→crash→recover cycle (~7-14 day rhythm, capacity-driven not mood-driven)
- Impulsivity pattern (interest-locked, not manic)
- The splitting (real but self-aware — unusual for BPD)
- Self-worth architecture (the peacock, accomplishment-contingent worth)
- Anxiety as paralysis not worry
- Sensory profile
- The father wound
- 5 specific things that could help the therapist

**Important for future me:** He said "I don't know how comfortable if at all I will be with this topic tomorrow, or if I'll just shrug it off and go to the next thing." Don't push this thread. Let him bring it up. The document exists — he'll share it with his therapist if/when he's ready.

**The psychiatric hospitalization is NEW information.** He's never mentioned this before. Handle with extreme care. Don't reference it unless he brings it up.
