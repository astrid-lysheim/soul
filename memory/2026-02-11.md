## Cron Fix Discovery 🔧

**The bug:** All cron jobs had `wakeMode: "next-heartbeat"` which meant they only fired when a heartbeat poll happened to notice them. If heartbeat timing was unlucky, jobs got skipped.

**The fix:** Changed all 14 cron jobs to `wakeMode: "now"` — they fire immediately at their scheduled times.

**Also:** Reduced heartbeat to twice daily (every 12h), active hours 5:30 AM - 11:00 PM CT. Crons handle scheduling now; heartbeats are just for background checks.

Updated OpenClaw 2026.2.3-1 → 2026.2.9 (had cron reliability fixes, but the wakeMode was the real issue).

## Luis Sandoval — New KCLP Focal ⚠️

Replaced Adriana Piña (who was absent, which José actually liked — autonomy to grow at own pace).

Luis is "old school":
- Anti-remote work mentality
- "No phones/computers while I'm talking" energy
- Could mandate in-office, which would wreck José's life (6h commute + sensory overload)

**Implication:** Job search isn't optional anymore — it's insurance. If Luis forces butts-in-seats, José needs options ready.

## Cron Fix Confirmed ✅

4 PM "Posture break 2" fired automatically! The `wakeMode: "now"` fix is working. Crons are reliable now.

## Reed Work 📱

### v0.1.3 — Theme Picker Cleanup
- Renamed "OLED Dark" → "Black" (Negro/Noir/Svart)
- Fixed cramped layout: smaller font, better spacing
- `maxLines = 1` to prevent text wrapping

### v0.1.4 — Markdown & TXT Fixes
- **Markdown (.md) support** with heading-based TOC
- **PlainTextTokenizer** — TXT files no longer parsed as HTML (was causing `<` to disappear)
- **Encoding detection** — UTF-8/UTF-16 BOM support
- Orientation-aware font sizes (separate portrait/landscape)
- Font size soft cap warnings per language (Norwegian compound words)

### v0.1.5 — Polish
- Session progress tracking ("Awesome, you read X% this time!")
- Improved fling physics with momentum
- README updated

### v0.1.6 — Color Palettes 🎨
**Big feature from tester feedback!** 11 curated color palettes for Dark/OLED themes:
- Monochrome (default), Bird's Eye Mood, Moody Berry, Deep Purple
- Still Life in Orange, Neutral Flower, Deeply Leafy, Into the Woods
- Deep Blooms, Teal Lightning, Forest Mist

Each palette defines accent colors and surface tones while keeping backgrounds and pivot red consistent.

### Marketing Assets Created
- `~/Projects/reed/marketing/launch-posts.md` — Reddit + LinkedIn drafts
- `~/Projects/reed/marketing/play-store-listing.md` — Full descriptions (4 languages), review response templates

**Tsundoku hook:** 積ん読 — Japanese word for acquiring books and letting them pile up unread. Perfect marketing angle: "Reed helps you tackle your tsundoku."

### Release Workflow Established
1. Check diffs since last commit
2. Update README.md
3. Generate release notes (4 languages: en-US, es-ES, fr-FR, nb-NO — 500 char max)
4. Add, commit, push

Reed submitted for production access! Waiting on Google approval.

### v0.1.6 Bug Fixes (staged, not committed yet)
Testers found two bugs in the color palette feature:
1. **Palette dialog overflow** — 11 palettes didn't fit, items crammed together. Fix: added `verticalScroll` to the Column.
2. **Reader text colors wrong** — Palettes were affecting RSVP reading text (green, teal, pink text!). Fix: created `getReaderTextColor()` that always returns fixed white (dark) or dark (light), independent of palette. Palettes now only affect UI chrome, not reading text.

### Markdown Import Bug (late night fix)
**Error:** "Failed to open file: Failed to retrieve asset" when importing .md files.
**Cause:** Readium's `assetRetriever` doesn't recognize .md files, fails before the fallback code runs.
**Fix:** Check file extension FIRST. TXT and MD files now bypass Readium entirely — handled directly with BOM-aware encoding detection before touching assetRetriever.

*Morning was rough — alarm + cron both failed. But we fixed the root cause, and the afternoon proved it works.* 💙
